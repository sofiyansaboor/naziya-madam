<span style="font-weight: 400">Is this going to be the year in which you quit the rat race? Or at least choose your own route for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People are job-hopping more than ever. Platforms like Fiverr make the gig economy stronger than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Plus, ever since we’ve all started working from home, we discovered that it’s actually quite cool to manage yourself, your time, and your projects—without someone physically looking over your shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unsurprisingly, a lot more people are finally discovering their entrepreneurial side, either by starting side-projects, or even by just taking the dive without any floaties like a permanent contract at a job they secretly hate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you also ready to take that plunge, but not sure yet in what direction to jump? You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, you could just take parts of your current job and start doing that independently—like many social media managers turned freelance copywriters do. But maybe you’re looking to do a complete 180, and want a job that fits the times we live in, matches with your passions, and doesn&#8217;t feel like a job at all, actually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’re not going to tell you how virtual assistants are in great demand and that dog sitting is fun. Instead, we’ve gathered 12 creative and fun ideas to inspire your entrepreneurial adventure. Ready to go?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Become a crypto coach</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you one of those people who somehow understand cryptocurrencies—and maybe even NFTs—and have you been successfully investing in all the right coins? That’s a great way to make an (extra) income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what if you could do more with all that knowledge? People are reading up about it, but at the end of the day, it’s a lot more comforting when someone actually tells you how and when to buy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s say, you know all about how to </span><a href="https://www.moonpay.com/buy/btc"><span style="font-weight: 400">buy BTC on Moonpay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, or any other type of bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could become a one-on-one coach about this, or even create an online course, to make this side-hustle all the more scalable.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>2. Start an at-home cooking service</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do your friends and family often come over to devour your food? Are you a master at meal prepping and making something amazing from the weirdest leftovers someone has in their fridge?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then you’re lucky, first of all. Many people struggle to come up with a pasta dish that isn&#8217;t the same as yesterday’s (and the ten days before) if they even have time to cook at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, you might not want to become a professional chef and spend most of your nights and weekends in a kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could consider starting a delivery service, but that would mean you’d spend more time driving around than cooking—and you want to do what you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">love</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So if you’re a talented cook, consider starting a local business where you go to other people&#8217;s houses to meal prep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can opt to do the groceries and create meals for the entire week in their kitchen—which also saves you your own kitchen and sanity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While this is a little of an upscale type of service, there are surely plenty of people around who are tired of the same old take-away every day and would love to try your fresh food!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Make yourself a hyper-specialized social media expert</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, social media marketing isn&#8217;t necessarily the most original job. But the big boys aren&#8217;t looking for generalists anymore, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their Instagram and LinkedIn are up and running, they just want to turn it into a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">success</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. So if you know how to use any platform like no one else, offer that as a service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, offer engagement services for Instagram. Or help people write great LinkedIn pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more specific it gets, the easier it’ll become to sell to people who already know what they’re doing—but acknowledge they need your help.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Become a remote work trainer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’ve been a digital nomad since before 2020, or you adapted incredibly easily, you’ve got a lot of valuable skills to teach others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people who are used to cubicles or trendy open-plan offices are still struggling with managing remote work. Which means their employers are also struggling with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can sell yourself to organizations as a remote work coach who will help them get the most out of their current employees, teaching them healthy ways to manage their work-life balance and boost their productivity. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Sell yourself as an ergonomic expert</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing on the previous point: a lot of people think they&#8217;ve got their home office routine completely under control. Meanwhile, they sound like a firecracker every time they get up for another cup of coffee. But no, they’re fine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’ve been working as a physiotherapist or in any other related field, and know a thing or two about working in a healthy position, market yourself to people who are working from home and don&#8217;t want to break their backs in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the right value proposition and laser-targeted market, plus maybe some referral deals and affiliate marketing with furniture stores, this could be a rather profitable business—and you’ll do a little good for others as well.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>6. Finally start that food truck!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this is not the time to recommend anyone to open a restaurant, we’re well aware. But if it&#8217;s always been a dream of yours, and you don&#8217;t like to be at the same place all the time anyway, why not open a food truck?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Admittedly, this is not a new concept, but it&#8217;s still a booming business, and perfectly fits the time we live in of outdoor events and being flexible. You could even use it to travel a little further and further because your market will simply be wherever you go.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>7. Travel planner for digital nomads</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oddly specific, right? That’s just how we like it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since remote work is becoming more accepted and standardized, people are dipping their toes into actual travel and work, instead of working from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if you think choosing a holiday destination is difficult, wait until you have to find a destination that has fast enough Wi-Fi to zoom your boss, has plenty of coworking spaces or at least coffee places that won&#8217;t kick you out when you type too loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of digital nomads have been there, done that, and if that’s you, consider helping people find their way in this world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could create guides on specific places and sell them, or make it all the more personal (and valuable!) by becoming a personal travel planner. You could even offer this service to companies who are encouraging their employees to use this time to explore the world while still getting the job done, for even more impact. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Become <i>that</i> specialized tour guide in your own city</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Live in a pretty place and know all about it? Now that tourism is starting to come back, you could use this coincidence to make a little money—while also getting out of the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there are plenty of standard businesses you could join to become a generic tour guide, pointing at the landmarks nobody was going to miss anyway. But with your specific, personal touch to it, you could make it into a little business too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, maybe you know all the best wine bars in your city, and you can create a tour around that. Or you were an enthusiastic dater in your early twenties and can show couples the most romantic spots in town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make it quirky, and make it specific. You could create tours especially for the elderly, or for families with kids. Market yourself in relevant places and start walking!</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Sell your photos as a stock photographer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have you always loved photography, and do you have countless pictures that are great—but not really useful for you? Sell them as stock photos! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this will probably <a href="https://www.printful.com/sell-art-online">start out as a small side gig</a>, but it&#8217;s nonetheless a lot of fun and gives you some reward for your creative work. You can upload your work on websites like Unsplash or Pexels and start earning money every time someone uses your photo. If things are looking up, you can even become more independent and start your own website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the amount of content that is being created every, well, minute, there&#8217;s a huge demand for stock footage, and anyone who frequently has to find that knows the most-used pictures by heart—so give them a fresh set of pictures!</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Dream big, but do bigger</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you can see, there’s a wide variety of options out there if you want to start a business. No matter how niche your passion is, you can turn it into a little more than that, even if it would just be to make a passive income from selling courses about your knitting obsession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re looking to double down on yourself and the opportunities out there nowadays, you’ll probably like this podcast on </span><a href="https://resources.audiense.com/blog/podcast-data-stories-leaders-at-work-gaelle-bertrand"><span style="font-weight: 400">developing yourself by seizing opportunities when they arrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, too. </span></p>

			<p>Keeping an eye on trends in the wider business community is always a good idea. Following sites like <a href="https://businesstrex.com/">businesstrex</a> will help you to keep your finger on the pulse when it comes to the latest developments and ideas.</p>
<p>Good communication is also a key business strategy. A good way of getting your message across is to use blogging as a way of engaging effectively with your core audience.</p>
<p>Here are four primary pointers about blogging that any business owner should be aware of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>It’s a great way to drive traffic to your website</h3>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons why blogging is so crucial to the success of your business is the fact that it gives you the perfect opportunity to convey great content to your target audience.</p>
<p>It is also a proven strategy for driving more traffic to your website.</p>
<p>It is a smart thing to do if you work on making your blog the heart of what you do on social media. Also, posting inbound <a href="https://www.milesburke.co/how-to-optimise-a-blog-post-for-seo/">links within your blogs</a> will provide you with the ability to drive traffic to targeted areas of your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Great for your SEO</h3>
<p>As a business owner, you will be acutely aware that delivering regular fresh content is great for your SEO.</p>
<p>Blogging presents you with a great way of using specific <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht">keywords</a> within your articles. This means that you can be super-savvy with your content by listing keywords and topics that you want your business to be aligned with.</p>
<p>Aside from these obvious benefits, regular blogging is a natural way of increasing your search keywords and boosting your marketing results in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Strengthen the bond between you and your customer</h3>
<p>Another key point about blogging is that it allows you the ability to develop and strengthen your relationships with new and existing customers.</p>
<p>Customers can learn more about what your business can offer them via the content you provide within your blog posts.</p>
<p>In addition, It can often be the case that you help to build that layer of trust that is key to a successful customer relationship when your blog is viewed as a reliable source of information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blogging helps with lead generation</h3>
<p>Many savvy business owners will happily testify that blogging is a fantastic way of converting visitors to your site into valuable leads.</p>
<p>A proven strategy for helping to make this happen is when you add a call to action within each post.</p>
<p>You can mix up the offering to see what works and to keep customers interested. For example, you can offer free product trials or maybe provide free and useful information that people will happily take in return for leaving their contact details.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that if you get your strategy right you can expect blog posts to deliver excellent returns for your effort. You need to take a long-term view of the strategy and build up your profile along the way.</p>
<p>Once you get the right level of attention, your business could really prosper from your blogging efforts.</p>

			<p>Instagram is in a league of its own, and the best part is that you can use it for anything. You can post about your product or brand to audiences from around the world. Here’s how to do just that to grow your car’s Instagram account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Build the Right Audience</h3>
<p>It all starts with building the right audience. You want to follow people who are already in your niche and are likely to be <a href="https://digiperform.com/best-digital-marketing-strategies-that-will-catch-audience-attraction/">attracted to your product</a>. They’ll be much more likely to follow you back too, and you’ll start increasing your audience rapidly.</p>
<p>When most social media platforms only let you target by country, Instagram lets you target users by their interests and even location down to a very specific place, so you can share your car business content with users that are more likely to be interested in it.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a car shop in San Francisco, you might set up your targeting to target users that like car shops or mechanics that are within a certain distance from your location. Then when they view your profile and like it, they’ll start seeing your posts in their feed as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Share a Variety of Posts</h3>
<p>Make sure to post a variety of content to be able to reach all types of users. The more you post, the more likely it is that you’ll be able to get your content seen by users that like your car content.</p>
<p>For example, you can post pictures of various cars you’re working on, photos of the different brands that come into your shop, or photos of the mechanics that work there. You can post videos as well. This sounds like a lot of content to make, but it’s actually not bad if you plan it out ahead of time and create standard templates for your posts so that they don’t take too long to create.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Focus on Sharing Quality Content</h3>
<p>It’s important to focus on the quality of your content if you want to lure in users that like your kind of business or brand. You want to show people that you’re a quality business, and you don’t want people to be unsatisfied with your products or services.</p>
<p>Before you focus on sharing the content related to cars, make sure to get a driving license. You need to attend a written and practical test that will assess your knowledge of road rules and the ability to drive safely. For the written test, you can <a href="https://www.driverknowledgetest.com.au/">practice DKT test</a> or be familiar with the questions according to your state, eg. the <a href="https://www.drivingtestcanada.ca/practice/g1-ontario">Ontario g1 practice test</a>.</p>
<p>You can share helpful posts like tutorials on how to clean your exhaust system, or something about how certain parts in other vehicles work. You can give useful advice for when someone is shopping for their next vehicle as well. You can also post about special events that you’re having or recent installations that you’ve done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Share Stories With Your Followers</h3>
<p>Followers are the people that have liked your account, so it’s important to interact with them.</p>
<p>You can give your followers a chance to be in the spotlight by sharing a story. When you do this, you’ll most likely reach out to people from around the world that are also part of your customer base.</p>
<p>Some followers will comment on the story and become more interested in following your profile. This can lead to more likes and <a href="https://digiperform.com/easy-ways-to-gain-followers-for-your-social-media-pages/">gain in followers</a>, and more money for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Posting photos using hashtags</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to grow your Instagram account is by posting photos that add meaning to these images without being too promotional. Your photo should become a part of the narrative that’s being told by IG’s community. This can be done by describing the photo using one or more hashtags. For example, #bmw can give you additional exposure by linking your post to a large community of BMW owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Host a giveaway</h3>
<p>By hosting a giveaway, you can increase your number of followers and likes from people that want to win whatever item you’re giving away. You can create a contest on Instagram, and then make the instructions for how to enter very clear.</p>
<p>You should make sure to post about your contest several times to ensure that it gets seen by all of your followers. You can host giveaways by collaborating with car companies as well. For example, you can create a promotion with a local car dealer where they’ll give away car products to your fans.</p>
<p>You just need to do a bit of work on your end and put in some effort to gain traction with your audience. By following the tips listed above, you can grow your car account on Instagram.</p>

			<p>Not every business believes in digital marketing and generating buzz at all costs. Not if it means faking reviews from bots and masquerading followers on platforms so that engagement is automatically high with more likes, shares, and subscriptions. But is that not what every business wants at both local and global levels?</p>
<p>For authentic customer or user engagement, you’ll need an expert behind the scenes. When you’ve established business goals and objectives, you’ll need to find an expert who is aligned with your organization.</p>
<p>Expert network platforms like <a href="https://cleverx.com/">CleverX</a> can help you find world-class talent from across the globe. But you still need to avoid expensive mistakes in <a href="https://cleverx.com/blog/the-basics-of-market-research/">market research</a> before you launch your next project.</p>
<p>Read on for the top five questions to ask yourself before you hire a digital marketing consultant for your e-commerce business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hiring a Digital Marketing Consultant for your Ecommerce Business</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Are they qualified?</h4>
<p>Here’s where you gauge how competent and knowledgeable the consultant is. You may want to look into projects that are along the lines of the work you need. Vetting out consultants would need you to look beyond the educational merits.</p>
<h4>2. How would to track and measure goals?</h4>
<p>Another crucial question to ask before you hire a consultant is how to track your progress to. Communicate with them and see how they prefer to work, document reports, and confirm the frequency at which they would offer advice.</p>
<p>If you are looking for non-strategic, performance-based work, you’ll need to set clear expectations there as well.</p>
<h4>3. What are their commercials?</h4>
<p>Gig-workers may charge by the hour, by the ROI, or by the project. Many <a href="https://web.ahttps://digiperform.com/top-15-digital-marketing-institute-in-noida/">digital marketing</a> experts charge a percentage of your marketing spends. You should know their payment preferences and see if that works for you before you decide to hire them.</p>
<h4>4. Are you aligned?</h4>
<p>While you are <a href="https://cleverx.com/blog/23-best-practices-to-negotiate-technology-contracts-in-2020/">negotiating terms</a>, it is important to find out which topics, decisions, or areas of advice they do not hold fiscal standards to. You can ask the consultant to disclose any potential conflicts of interest. It may also help if you ask your advisor for a reference if you have not already approached them through one. You can talk to the references yourself for a better understanding.</p>
<h4>5. Do they have the secret ingredient?</h4>
<p>Transparency is the secret ingredient. It is important to be able to express things that matter to you and receive simple advice without jargon. You will need to have these negotiated terms signed in black and white and easily verifiable.</p>
<p>Transparency breeds social trust, two foundational experiences for a healthy working relationship with your consultant.</p>
<p>Before you sign up, remember to knock these things off your checklist.</p>
<p>Ask yourself if the consultant is making you feel like your problem is too complex to be managed by yourself.</p>
<p>The ideal expert would give you the flexibility and <a href="https://digiperform.com/9-agile-practices-every-digital-marketing-team-should-adopt/">agility</a> to take back your business challenges into your own hands. Even though, that external point of view will bring immense value to whatever you’re working on.</p>

			<p>Customer call centres need to change. At least, that is, if we look at customer satisfaction rates over the last decade. In 2010,  global customer satisfaction with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/802285/global-contact-center-satisfaction-index/">private call centres was 75%</a>. Just ten years later, that figure drops to 71%.</p>
<p>Considering the advances in technology in the intervening time, this was an unexpected outcome. If anything, we expected customer satisfaction to improve. A close analysis of the statistics might indicate the reason for the decline.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, global customer satisfaction was just 68%. The 2020 figures, therefore, indicate that we did something correctly in 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What might that have been?</h3>
<p>For one thing, companies were managing the fallout of covid-19. They were scrambling to provide service by any means necessary without worrying about the bottom line. As a result, clients received access to more service consultants and also innovative measures like voice bots.</p>
<p>The bots made it possible to direct calls quickly and efficiently and answer simple questions. However,<a href="https://financesonline.com/chatbot-statistics/"> 59% of business owners</a> believe that chatbots struggle to understand the nuances of human communication.</p>
<p>The recognizable difference, therefore, is that the bots allowed companies to collate queries from several platforms. The client benefited by having one centralized support department irrespective of how they lodged their question.</p>
<p>The focus on customer support, providing a centralized omnichannel response, and appropriate use of technology raised customer satisfaction by 3% in one year. What makes this achievement impressive, however, is that this was the most brutal business year this millennium. However, with technology like <a href="https://getvoip.com/blog/business-phone-systems/">VoIP phone systems</a> businesses were able to take customer support to the next level and succeed.</p>
<p>Going forward, it makes sense for businesses to consider the benefits of adopting an omnichannel centralized approach. In this article, we’ll examine those advantages and see how <a href="https://supportyourapp.com/call-center-outsourcing/">professional support experts</a> might implement them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How Centralized, Omnichannel Customer Support May Benefit Your Organization</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>One-Stop Service</h4>
<p>Raise Your Hand if the following interaction sounds Familiar:</p>
<p><b>Client</b>: “Hi, my account number is 1245-4550-788. Please tell me what my installment this month is.”</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “I’m sorry, I’m in sales, and I don’t have access to that information. I can transfer you to accounts; please hold.”</p>
<p>The customer holds for a few minutes, and then the next consultant comes on the line:</p>
<p><b>Client</b>: “Hello, is those Accounts? My number is 1245-4550-788, and I need my installment for this month, please.”</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “ I’m sorry, you’re through to the switchboard. The accounts department is busy on another call. May I try someone else for you?”</p>
<p>With a big sigh, the customer says,” Yes.”  and waits for the next person to answer.</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “Good morning,  this is Joe; how may I help you?”</p>
<p><b>Client</b>: “Hi Joe,  are you in Accounts?”</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “No,  I’m in Tech Support, but I was passing the Accounts department and answered the phone. Can I give them a message for you or get them to call you back?”</p>
<p>The conversation is typical of what many clients experience when companies silo departments. Each section is only responsible for a small aspect of service. They cannot assist the client with anything outside of that.</p>
<p>In our example, the client dealt with three consultants, none of whom could answer his question. With a centralized call center, however, the client would call one number, and the consultant would be able to assist him immediately. If the agent didn’t know the answer to the question, they’d find out and tell the client.</p>
<p>The upside for the client is that there’s no playing phone tag or endlessly repeating his details. The upside for the company is increased productivity because agents don’t deal with calls outside their ambit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Omnichannel Monitoring Keeps You Up to Date on Client Needs</h3>
<p>Clients today have several platforms from which to communicate. If you’re lucky, they’ll lodge complaints with your service line. When clients decide not to take this course, however, they have several outlets in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media pages</li>
<li>Online groups</li>
<li>Review sites</li>
<li>Forums</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies must monitor for mentions of their names online. They should then engage with the clients no matter what the platform is. Adopting a centralized approach makes it far simpler to collate these mentions and send out a consistent brand message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Final Notes</h3>
<p>Going forward, companies must act as cohesive units. It’s crucial to start blurring the distinction between departments, especially where the customer is concerned. Operating a centralized, omnichannel support center makes it easy for clients to get the assistance they need. They also boost company productivity.</p>

			<p><b>Want A Boost In Your Venture? Here Are Top Reasons Why You Need A Mobile-Friendly Website</b></p>
<p><b><i>It is said that old is gold. However, that’s not how it goes with technology. </i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the advancement of technology day by day, the entire genre of marketing, advertisement, and e-commerce has changed. Gone are those days when traditional paper pamphlets or word-of-mouth publicity would have taken your venture sky high.</p>
<p>Nowadays to tap into the global market scenario, and to be the global leader you need a properly designed and enticing mobile responsive website.</p>
<p>So if you want a boost in your business, then it’s high time for you to develop a <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-10-reasons-why-you-need-a-mobile-friendly-website/">mobile responsive website</a>.</p>
<p><b>Numbers and Stats</b></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/">report from Statista</a> shows that the total number of mobile phone users all across the globe is expected to reach 4.68 billion by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>And hence, true to its saying, those ventures that are still not into catering to mobile users through their web pages are surely paving way for their extinction.</p>
<p><b>A brief march of time</b></p>
<p>The concept of designing mobile-friendly web pages isn’t that old. The first website that can adapt according to the browser viewpoint was designed and launched by a car giant around 2001. The terms fluid, flexible, liquid, and elastic were a few synonyms used in mobile-friendly webpage designs until in 2010 a developer phased responsive web design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasons for designing a mobile-responsive website</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Increasing the availability and traffic of a website: </b>Mobile phones are easy to use and the availability of the internet has made it possible for users to access the web page at any point anywhere. Desktop or laptops aren’t always available to a website that is not mobile-friendly already pushes away more than half of its traffic to a competitor mobile responsive site.</p>
<p><b>2. Experience class apart:</b> A crucial aspect for any website is its experience as perceived by the users. When a website is used in a mobile or tablet interface, it changes its design from an evenly designed page to a vertical configuration.  This transformation in configuration brings in a number of displays and designs together.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.tisdigital.com/responsive-website-design.php">method of configuration is known as Responsive Website Design</a> (RWD), where the website properly fits according to the screen size of the gadget by contracting pictures, displays, and contents thus providing the user with a class experience without tiresome navigation.</p>
<p><b>3. Cost-effectiveness</b>:  For designing any website every entrepreneur thinks about the cost. Strange as it might occur to you, a mobile-friendly page is in fact, cost-effective. Before the advent of RWD design, people had to design different websites for different platforms thus doubling or tripling the building cost. However, with a responsive design, a single site can serve all.</p>
<p><b>4. Increase in sales</b>: Of course, the ultimate purpose for designing a website is marketing the brand across platforms. With the advent of smartphones and easy internet, the prominence of e-commerce is gaining day by day.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.studio98.com/5-reasons-website-mobile-friendly/">report showed in 2013</a>, that there were only 10% of districts buying online goods through mobiles whereas within two years that rate doubled. So it goes without saying that a mobile responsive site will tap on a huge customer pool.</p>
<p><b>5. </b><b>Improved Google rankings: </b>This is beyond any doubt that Google is the biggest search engine of all time. A report suggested that more than 96% of users use Google as their primary search engine. Thus Search Engine Optimization ranks to become a deciding factor for the number of hits on the website.</p>
<p>From the user end, the only first few in lists are generally checked. A mobile-responsive user-friendly website is recognized by Google and is given a higher SEO rank thus getting it more hits from potential targeted customers.</p>
<p><b>6. Enhancement of loading speeds</b>:  Now speed and fast connectivity act as a key factor for any website. According to standards set by ‘Google Page Speed Developers’, the content on the top of a page should load under 1 second and the rest of the page within 2-3 seconds.</p>
<p>These ridiculously high-speed standards cannot be reached by a desktop webpage as they are evenly designed and are a lot heavier. The prolonged time for a page to load acts as a major turn down for customers and instead of waiting they prefer to move to a user-friendly website.</p>
<p><b>7. Optimizing the page elements</b>: A mobile responsive web page adjusts according to the screen size but with all the contents, graphics and displays. So, the user experience is much effectual and customers can find all the information they are looking for.</p>
<p><b>8. Analytics friendly</b>: Customer analytics refers to future planning, rectification, and implementations for any venture. However creating analytics reports for customer preferences, logins for multiple versions of sites, and tracking all such through a multitude of conversion paths, redirects, funnels are complex and has high chances of data mishap.</p>
<p>However, a mobile responsive site is easier to maintain and document all analytics. Some major analytics like Google Analytics nowadays caters and merges all the reports of mobile-responsive pages into a single one.</p>
<p><b>9. Improved offline browsing: </b>Another latest feature is offline browsing. With HTML5-enabled smartphones, mobile-responsive pages enable users to continue viewing the contents within the HTML5 web app even without an internet connection<b>.</b></p>
<p><b>10. Lower Maintenance</b><b>: </b>A responsive page is all fits within one design. So while designing or while maintaining it creates a lesser headache for testing, bug fixing and optimizing thus giving you more time to focus on content and marketing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>To sum it up</h3>
<p>While we reach the end of the discussion, it’s evident that mobile phones are the future and thus a mobile-responsive web page is the only solution that reduces your time and efforts on one end while giving you more customers, and business on the other. Entrepreneurs, marketers, and business owners gain the opportunity to reach out to a customer pool that engages with their brand and its offerings, which in turn shoots up their ROIs.</p>

			<p>An effective marketing strategy is a crucial requirement for all businesses, especially when your business is in its early stages.</p>
<p>Your marketing strategy can make all the difference in how fast your business grows. So, it’s one of the key points that you must focus on.</p>
<p>Now, running and planning to expand your eCommerce business is often quite tricky. That’s where search engine optimization (SEO) can make things simpler for you.</p>
<p>It plays a crucial role in your online marketing strategy. So, you must utilize it to its fullest to benefit your eCommerce business.</p>
<p>Don’t know where to start? No worries, we have some useful SEO tips to help you out with that. But, before that, you might want to know how this concept works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does SEO work?</h2>
<p>As you know, there is a wide range of eCommerce businesses out there. Moreover, customers have many options to choose from across all sectors.</p>
<p>Now, to look for a certain product online, needless to say, they have to search for it. The results they get are always in a particular order. You’ll find a certain website always at the top for a certain search word.</p>
<p>Now, customers usually open the top search results that they get. So, every eCommerce business would always want to rank high among search results.</p>
<p>Now, how does a website get to that position? As you might have guessed, that’s where <a href="https://uaewebsitedevelopment.com/seo-services-for-ecommerce-websites/">eCommerce SEO</a> comes into the picture.</p>
<p>Optimizing your content according to customer trends will help your eCommerce site rank high among search results. And, that in turn would bring in more visitors to your website. And, for that, you simply need to apply the right SEO practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6 Best SEO Tips for your eCommerce website</h2>
<p>There are many ways to utilize SEO to benefit your online business website. But, there are some essential steps that you must take for that. So, here are some SEO tips that would help you increase your website’s ranking:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Maintain SSL Certification For Your Website</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The content surely plays an important role in a website’s ranking in search results. But, whether the search engine trusts the site is yet another crucial factor. Now, what makes a browser trust your web page? In case you’re wondering, it’s an SSL certificate. So, you must make sure that your website always has one. After all, SSL certificates come with a certain validity period.</p>
<p>Also, you must get the certification from a provider whom the search engine trusts. What happens if you don’t have an SSL certificate? In such cases, your site data won’t have any protection.</p>
<p>Thus, people who try to visit it will face a privacy error. As a result, they might not want to visit it, which will affect the site ranking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Make Your Content Unique</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your eCommerce website would have a wide range of products. Also, each of them would have a certain description. Now, as it happens, you’re not the only one offering those products to your customers.</p>
<p>Instead, there are many other businesses out there that are competing with you. And, they use a specific description for their products as well.</p>
<p>Thus, you must make sure that you uniquely describe your products. In other words, it must not match with that of another site. For that, you should avoid using the description that the manufacturer uses for the product. Instead, simply write all the descriptions for your products in your own words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Place Enough Keywords In Your Text</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your customers will search for products using a particular keyword. Then, the search engine will show results that contain that word. Keywords play an important role in your site’s ranking.</p>
<p>After all, they indicate the contents of your website to the search engine. Now, your content must have a minimum number of keywords. Otherwise, it won’t make much difference to your website’s ranking.</p>
<p>There might be multiple keywords that you need to use in your content. In that case, place each of them naturally throughout the text. Make sure not to force them into any part of your content. After all, that will only deteriorate its quality, which can bring down your ranking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Use More Specific Keywords</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some general keywords that pretty much all of your competitors would use. That indicates you would face a considerable amount of competition when you use them.</p>
<p>So, it gets a little more challenging for you to rank high in search results. Therefore, you’d want to reduce the competition to make that easier for you.</p>
<p>And, for that, you must avoid using general terms and use more specific ones instead. For example, suppose you’re offering sports shoes to your customers on your website.</p>
<p>Now, using the keyword “sports shoes” is going to get you into competition with hundreds of competitors. To avoid that, you must add a location or other specific details. That brings down the number of competitor websites that you have to compete with for ranking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Use The Appropriate Heading Tags</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The tags you use in your headings are more important than you might think. The search engine uses them to understand the hierarchy of your content. So, you must make sure that the search bots can read them properly.</p>
<p>And, for that, you have to use the correct tags. Always use H1 for your titles and H2 for subtitles. If there’s a title within an H2, you must use the H3 tag for it.</p>
<p>What happens when you use incorrect tags? In such cases, the search engine can’t read it properly. As a result, it won’t be able to rightly determine the hierarchy of the content.</p>
<p>Apart from that, visitors would find it harder to browse through the pages of your website. Now, that would surely affect your site’s ranking in the search results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Include Customer Reviews On Your Website</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you offer a service or product to your customers, you’d want their feedback. After all, it’ll help you satisfy them, and hence you can witness growth in your eCommerce business.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it’ll also let you create better strategies and make better decisions. If there are any issues with your service, you can know that easily from customer reviews. That will help you make the necessary changes to remove any shortcomings on your part.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it’ll allow customers to interact with your business. Now, that’s one of the key requirements for any business to grow. That’s why all prominent eCommerce websites allow customers to share their feedback through ratings and comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finally……</h2>
<p>So, it is clear that you need more visitors to your website to grow your eCommerce business. And, for that, you must increase the number of visitors that your website gets.</p>
<p>You need a well-planned SEO strategy for that. Also, you must make sure to include the above-mentioned essential practices in it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, they’d help you gain a significant number of organic traffic on your website. Apart from that, you can apply many other effective practices as well.</p>

<p>Let’s deep-dive into the top digital marketing trends of 2021, to put your brand in the palm of your audience’s hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Digital marketing trends of 2021</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. In-email Purchases</h3>
<p>While email marketing has existed for years now, its purpose has always been limited to marketing communication or directing people to a landing page, product page, or blog post.</p>
<p>Now according to mail chimp’s new feature, you can further <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-write-exciting-loyalty-program-emails-to-boost-customer-engagement/">boost engagement with emailers</a> by adding app-like features such as purchase options, embedded video, and interactive tools all within their inbox.</p>
<p>Also, MailChimp now offers super sophisticated targeting, based on user’s purchase history, google search history, most visited apps or websites, and much more.</p>
<p>Emailers have always been a great medium of understanding one’s consumer and their requirements, receiving feedback, and generating leads.</p>
<p>However, now brands can go a step further with emailers and can conduct actual sales via email. In-email purchases are a must-use digital marketing trend for e-commerce businesses all over the globe.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Virtual reality</h3>
<p>This pandemic has changed the world in a lot of ways and has accelerated digital transformation in all fields. Brands have started creating simulated environments, to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/12-ways-to-improve-user-experience">enhance user experience</a>.</p>
<p>Companies are now creating immersive experiences with virtual reality by giving inputs to the computer. The high engagement rate that VR garners make it a great tool for education and entertainment purpose.</p>
<p>Youtube, a popular video streaming platform has launched its standalone app optimized especially for VR called ‘Youtube VR’. With this app, users can choose to watch any video with an immersive VR experience. Brands can be ready for this changing dynamics of the digital world, with these small changes in user experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Voice Search</h3>
<p>The key factor that a digital marketer should consider at each stage of marketing is how can they further make the user journey convenient for their audience.</p>
<p>20% of the search queries are voice searches, according to Google’s Ceo Sundar Pichai. Voice search saves the user from the hassle of typing and scrolling.</p>
<p>And now with gadgets like Google Home and Alexa, users are more inclined towards asking for information through voice search versus typing it out.</p>
<p>As this user behavior grows, companies need to start incorporating voice search and accordingly optimize content for their digital marketing strategies.</p>
<p>The foremost step would be to create content in a more conversational style that matches their user’s style of asking questions while searching. Try voice search, the latest digital marketing trend to reach new audiences and outdo your competitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Artificial intelligence</h3>
<p>It is of utmost importance for marketers to segment their audience for digital experiences. Your audiences preferences could be difficult to track but for your digital marketing strategies to perform well, you need to have a clear segmentation.</p>
<p>AI can much more efficiently dissect and analyze behavioral, psychographic, and demographic data than a human doing it manually. These AI collected valuable insights can then be used by digital marketers to optimize and improve their marketing strategies.</p>
<p>A brand can be creating fresh content daily to keep up the engagement, but is the content meaningful to the user? With AI, brands can create personalized content which is key to driving engagement.</p>
<p>AI is capable of consuming and crunching large amounts of data per user to create customized content for them. Netflix with the help of AI provides personalized recommendations to the users on basis of their interests and search history. Using this digital marketing trend, Netflix has successfully created a huge audience base all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Chatbots</h3>
<p><a href="http://chatbots/">Chatbots</a> allow businesses to converse with their customers in order to improve customer relationships, earn brand goodwill and garner more sales.</p>
<p>When it comes to consumer products, businesses have discovered the convenience and effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots are a relatively new trend in digital marketing, However, 80% of the marketers are already using or plan to use chatbots in their digital marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>6. Video Marketing &amp; Webinars</h3>

<p>It packages information and entertainment in a short amount of time and gets your brand the much need traction. Most people prefer watching videos to reading blog posts or articles, making the video format highly relatable to most of the audience.</p>
<p>With video content being such a massive hit, audiences enjoy any type of video be it tutorials, sneak peeks, fun bloopers, or short stories. Just keep the video relevant and in alignment with your brand voice.</p>
<p>During the covid pandemic, we have seen a tremendous rise in the consumption of videos and webinars. Webinar’s interactive nature makes learning easy and efficient for the audience.</p>

			<p>In this digital era, good access to content and data from online sources may be all you need to have the upper hand in the occupation you are in.</p>
<p>Web developers have come up with many strategies to ease access to information from the internet. One of the ways that clearly stands out is web scraping/crawling. With web crawlers, you can gather and analyze information faster, conveniently, and in a highly affordable manner.</p>
<p>You must not even purchase crawlers. You can make your own with methods such as python coding, browsers’ extension, or even use data extraction tools such as Zenscrape.</p>
<p>Despite the flexibility in creating/accessing crawlers and the benefits that web scraping offers, there are still hurdles when it comes to usage. There are sites that you can’t access even if you have crawlers. In some cases, you’ll only scrape information to a certain level.</p>
<p>Another important factor is captcha solving, if your scraping efforts aren’t able to go through it, you won’t get any data and you would be wasting your bandwidth. You can find a lot of comprehensive information on how to go around this issue <a href="https://proxyway.com/guides/how-to-bypass-captcha">by reading this guide</a>.</p>
<p>It is the work of the same web developers to create anti-scraping tools. With this, they make sure that they win either way (from the information owners and the information seekers). So, do you feel like the crawlers you have are not serving their intended purpose because of limited usage? We have good news for you- You can still go around all the obstacles that prevent you from crawling.</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss two easy techniques that you can use to beat anti-scraping. Let’s dive directly into them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. IP Address</h3>
<p>Your Internet Protocol address is like an identity that is held responsible for all activities that you perform on a site. Websites will track your IP if they notice some weird behavior and try to establish if the activities under your IP are human or robotic. If your IP address makes very many requests simultaneously within a particular period (which is obviously what a scraping bot will do), the website may block it.</p>
<p>So, when are your scraping activities likely to be suspected and blocked?</p>
<p>• When you send too many requests within a very short period- Websites assume that humans are generally slower and that there is a certain number of requests they are supposed to send in a given period.</p>
<p>Solution: Reduce the request you send in a given period. Leverage techniques such as ‘sleep’ function or increasing waiting time between two requests.</p>
<p>• When you are always visiting a website at the same time- Again, websites don’t expect humans to clock some level of accuracy and consistency and hence will treat highly accurate and consistently timed activities as scraping.</p>
<p>Solution: Make the scraping speed random</p>
<p>• Consistent requests from varying IPs- Even if your crawler uses various IPs, the activities/requests should not be timed at a particular time as this will be recognized by advanced anti-scraping techniques.</p>
<p>Solution: Use rotating IPs with random scraping speeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Captchas</h3>
<p>‘Captcha’ is the contraction of ‘Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers And Humans Apart. The Captcha is the kind of image that prompts you to do certain tasks such as clicking particular items or doing some calculations in order to access the content of a page.</p>
<p>Captchas’ main aim is to dictate tasks that only humans can tackle and not robots.</p>
<p>The use of Captchas has evolved to be one of the most effective anti-scraping techniques for website owners. Although it has been hard for web crawlers to pass this obstacle in the past, now there is an open-source tool that you can use to bypass all Captcha challenges when using crawlers.</p>
<p>The open-source tool, however, is not one of the easiest to create. It requires high proficiency in programming.</p>
<p>Another way people use to beat Captcha obstacles is making feature libraries that enable the creation of image recognition techniques using high-end learning or machine skills. Again, this may not be suitable for you and that’s why you still need a better solution.</p>
<p>The most promising and easiest way to beat anti-scraping when you are not the person who will spend hours and hours coding is simply reducing your scraping activities. This way, you’ll trick the anti-scraping features not to focus on your scraping tools. Eventually, the suspicion will be over and you’ll be able to crawl the website without any limitations.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>We hope you have enjoyed this post and now know how you can beat anti-scraping and proceed with your information crawling as normal. No matter how fun solving captchas automatically may look to you, it requires very advanced skills and unless you are the finest in the game, you should stick to the IPs tricks.</p>
