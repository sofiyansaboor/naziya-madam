Is it really important to follow online marketing trends if any business wants to survive the competition?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you still have questions, this piece of post is made especially for you which will give you the answers of your all questions!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the post, we have shared what is Digital Marketing, why to invest in digital marketing and what are some of the key benefits of digital marketing. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though, Customer Attraction and Loyalty, better positioning for the brand in the market and excellent return on investment are some of them. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As a result, your business can benefit &#8211; directly or indirectly &#8211; from the possibilities established through digital marketing campaigns.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is important to note, however, that these benefits are only reaped by companies that do good digital marketing planning and have the necessary tools and knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Want to know, then, where to start and create a more digital presence for your brand?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So check out the key benefits of applying digital marketing strategies! But first,</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Why invest in digital marketing?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is on the internet that the modern consumer seeks references about a brand or product. Before buying furniture, for example, it is common for the buyer to research like other consumers and evaluate the delivery, the quality of the material and the service of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s also online that they look for answers to problems &#8211; including those that can be solved by your company.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Having a strong digital presence is essential to attracting the attention of these potential customers as well as creating a strong relationship with those who already know your brand and products.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What are the benefits of digital marketing?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Want to understand in practice how digital marketing helps your business attract a qualified consumer to your pages, accompany them along their buying journey, and build customer loyalty? Here are the answers:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, next, we will highlight 6 of the main benefits of investing in digital marketing strategies. They are:</span></p>

<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>1. Democratic environment</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The benefits of digital marketing can be enjoyed by small, medium and large companies in the industry, as well as in other segments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Unlike conventional advertising &#8211; such as television and radio &#8211; through the Internet, it is possible to reach thousands of potential customers with little money. This enables small and medium businesses to advertise their products as efficiently as the big ones.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>2. Measurable Results</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One of the great revolutions brought about by digital marketing is the possibility to follow the result of each action taken. Better yet, you can monitor your audience&#8217;s reaction in real-time. This makes campaigns even more efficient.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If an action does not work, it indicates that something needs to be modified. But what promotes consumer engagement or positively influences sales must be reinforced.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Data provided by metrics such as the number of people visiting your site are great allies in building effective digital campaigns, where the budget is directed to actions that bring results.</span></p>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Analytics-.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-24342 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Analytics-.png" alt="Google-Analytics-" width="680" height="388" /></a>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>3. Open Dialogue with Customers</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The relationship between brand and customer has evolved a lot with the popularization of the internet. The modern consumer wants to know that their opinions are heard.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You also want answers to your questions and complaints. Digital marketing makes this communication happen simply and quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The tone of the language depends on the audience profile of your company. But social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, are effective means of communicating with people of all ages and social classes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to keeping the dialogue with the consumer open, messaging ensures that the public&#8217;s relationship with the company is strengthened.</span></p>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online-review.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-24257 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online-review.jpg" alt="online review" width="690" height="384" /></a>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>4. Audience Segmentation</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Personalization of care is an essential factor for customer loyalty. Digital marketing also simplifies this task by allowing you to target your audience.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thus, it is possible to send specific emails to consumers depending on the stage of the buying journey they are in, for example. Campaigns are much better targeted and actions gain more efficiency.</span></p>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-04-at-11.50.58-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-24383 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-04-at-11.50.58-PM.png" alt="Automated segmentation in emails" width="1405" height="799" /></a>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>5. Market Positioning</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Well-designed digital actions also contribute to the brand being recognized as a reference in the market &#8211; both against customers and competitors.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By creating relevant content, for example, the company generates value for its consumers and shows that it has deep knowledge about the area in which it operates.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>6. Long-lasting results</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Digital marketing does not work only with measurable results in the short term. When we evaluate the ROI of online campaigns, we can appreciate that these actions last for a long time yet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After all, digital content remains in your database &#8211; always available to your target audience&#8217;s interest when doing a new search online.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As a result, even old content can come up with new things to continually attract new leads to your business.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not to mention that this accumulation of <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing</a> only reinforces your authority on the subject &#8211; as highlighted in previous topics &#8211; and enhances your online reputation.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>How to improve your digital strategy?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The advantages brought by digital marketing are many, as long as the brand invests in planning and has access to the knowledge that ensures the actions are well executed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Learning digital marketing or Hiring a digital marketing agency with subject matter expertise is a great way to bring this knowledge to your brand&#8217;s digital strategy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A good agency like <a href="https://zoetalentsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Zoe Talent Solutions</a> has experience in using tools that enhance the actions are taken, where many of these tools are free. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The agency also has the expertise to track results, improve strategy direction, and ensure a performance-focused campaign.</span></p>

<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>Focus on Goals</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Good campaign planning is important from the start. Your audience profile should be well defined, as should your campaign goals. It is important to focus on these goals and the results achieved in each action taken.</span></p>

<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><b>Active Company</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Digital presence is not synonymous with creating a Facebook fan page. It takes time to get your official pages engaging.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Publishing relevant content that interests your audience is part of this process. It is also important to reply to messages and any other interaction you receive.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We hope this article has helped to delve into the subject and understand how digital marketing is essential to boost your brand.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead generation is the major problem that every business faces today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">68% of business struggles with <a href="https://digiperform.com/5-lead-generation-tactics-that-work-for-every-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead generation</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which means that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most businesses are struggling to earn profits.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And to create a profitable business you need to have good quality leads because leads will bring you more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">money, revenue and profits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not having quality leads, your entire business operation will be struck</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down because you don’t have a customer base to sell your products. Hence, if you don’t want your business to run in losses, you need to have good leads.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing comes into play.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing gives you enormous techniques through which you can generate high quality leads for your business.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following are some techniques.</span>
<h4><strong>SEO</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine optimization will play an important role in generating leads. It helps you to drive high-quality traffic for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">search</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> engines, which you can convert into leads.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today 59% of b2b marketers are using SEO as a lead generation tool, and 57% of b2b marketers believe SEO generates more leads than other online marketing techniques.</span>

<h4><strong>Blogging</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of my personal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">favorite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lead generation techniques, which I love the most. I feel that blogging is one of the best lead generation methods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you should use.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to HubSpot, the company that publishes 16+ blog post in a month generates 3 times more leads than the company who don</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t.</span>
<h4><strong>Email marketing:</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, this is another great tool for generating leads. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of b2b marketers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are using</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> email marketing as one of their tools for generating leads.</span>
<h2><strong>6) Ease of doing:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another great advantage of digital marketing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing techniques are very easy to learn and implement. In fact, these techniques are so easy that even an 8th-grade student can apply it and run a marketing campaign.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, in traditional marketing, you need plans too many things such as marketing budget, marketing channel, corporate meetings and many other such things which makes traditional marketing a difficult and time-consuming task.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such things may lead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to postponing your marketing campaign.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, if you want to start your marketing campaign with no troubleshoot problems, opt for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing.</span>
<h2><strong>7) Too many techniques:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gone are the days where business where limited to only a few marketing techniques such as television ads and print media. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the growth of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing, the business has more marketing techniques than ever, which helps them to reach more audience, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the campaign, get more returns, generate more profits and many other benefits.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing has made it possible for businesses to reach their target audience on a variety of channels such as social media, mobile phones, search engines, emails, and many other online platforms.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All this is possible only because of multiple techniques which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing gives you.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are some techniques which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing gives you.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine optimization.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine marketing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blogging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media marketing.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use all these techniques at the same time and start your marketing campaign.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/marketing-strategy-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-23780 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/marketing-strategy-1.jpg" alt="marketing-strategy (1)" width="559" height="349" /></a>
<h2><strong>8) Automation:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The wave of marketing automation is becoming stronger day by day. By the end of 2023, investment in marketing automation will double. This means more and more businesses will use marketing automation tools.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, this is the right time for you to use marketing automation in your marketing campaign, and to do this, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing is the right platform which gives you ample of opportunities for marketing automation.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing techniques such as email marketing, chatbots, SMS marketing, missed call marketing, and inbound marketing, you can automate your marketing campaign and eliminate the repetitive tasks involved in marketing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so will save you time and effort.</span>
<h2><strong>9) Tracking ads:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another great advantage of digital marketing which I like the most.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are running ads, you need to know how many people are watching it, how many liked it, how many clicked on it, how many disliked it and other such metrics.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such metrics will help you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your ad campaign and improve its performance, you can know what</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s working and what</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s not, and you can also save your money and improve your ROI.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not tracking your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ads</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driving a car with closed eyes. There is no clarity about whether your ad campaign is performing well. But this will happen only in the case of traditional ads. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, when you run ads on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform, you have complete control over your ads. You can monitor them and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make changes in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your ad campaign. This gives you complete authority over your ad campaign.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tracking-facebook-ads-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-23781 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tracking-facebook-ads-1.png" alt="tracking facebook ads (1)" width="1434" height="650" /></a>
<h2><strong>10) Remarketing:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another important reason for which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing becomes utmost important for your business. When you run ads on traditional mediums such as television and newspaper, you don’t get an opportunity for running a remarketing campaign.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this is not the case with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing you can show your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ads</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers who visited your website and left without purchasing your product or services.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you get another opportunity for converting those people into sales who left your website without taking the desired action.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a remarketing campaign is only possible when you are running ads on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or on search engines.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remarketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will also help you in the following ways:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can stay in touch with your audience.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your brand awareness.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases your sales and conversion.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow your customers and many other benefits.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>11) Competitors analysis:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what your competitors are doing is a crucial part of any marketing campaign. It helps in knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors within your market, and you can use the same for staying ahead of your competitors.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> competitors strategy you can know their key points and marketing techniques which they are using so you, too, can use such techniques in your marketing campaign.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing also allows you to conduct a detailed website audit of your competitor which helps you in knowing their traffic sources, backlinks source and many other important metrics about their website.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such metrics, you too can plan your SEO strategy and win over your competitors.</span>

<h2><strong>12) Product development and innovation:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New product development is important for any business because it helps in getting new opportunities, new customers, more market share and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">huge profits.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the question arises is how to develop a new and innovative product?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new product is an expensive and risky task, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing can help you at the product development stage.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing strategies like social media marketing you can</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">develop a new product with no effort and risk. On social media, you can interact with the potential &amp; existing customers and get some product ideas from them.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get data about your existing customer new needs and wants and use it for developing the product.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also conduct a pool or opinion on social media and get some valuable results for your product development.</span>
<h2><strong>13) All pervasive</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great feature of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing is its universal applicability. Any </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can use every </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">techniques, methods and strategies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with irrespective of its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">turnover, size, and nature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, almost many industries are using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing techniques for growth and development. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, e-commerce giant Amazon uses it for getting customers, leads and sales, whereas small startup like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-brain </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solution uses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing for brand awareness and targeting.</span>
<h2><strong>14) Your competitors are using it</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The magnitude of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing has compelled every business </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have dedicated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing strategy, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for this reason, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more and more businesses are increasing their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing budget.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, businesses don’t feel to invest in traditional marketing techniques such as T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">V ads, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newspapers, billboards, and flyers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their interest is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slowly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shifting towards investment in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is the reason for the growth of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing budget and spending.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-advertising-digital/global-spending-on-digital-marketing-nears-100-billion-study-idUSKCN1M30XN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">frankfurt (</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">returns), spending on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing by companies from the USA and UK amounted to $52 billion. This estimates that the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing industry will soon </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enter into $</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 billion clubs.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The above facts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indicate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most companies, including your competitors, will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be opting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing in the coming future, which makes it necessary for you to use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing for surveying into the competitive market.</span>
<h4><strong>Wrapping it up</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The above-stated reasons </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly indicate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">important for your business to survive in the wave of digitization. Hence, it would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be good</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">start using</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing for now onwards.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monica Gandhi, Business Head at Technicians, is a natural “<em>Trusted Advisor</em>” who helps companies to meet their sales and marketing targets. In this post, she has shared the <em><strong>10 Things to Consider Before Going for <a href="http://www.purplesyntax.com/SEO-Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Services</a></strong></em><strong>.</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are looking for the best <a href="https://seoserviceinindia.co.in/">SEO services in India</a> or any other country these factors will support in finding the perfect service for your organization. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a good practice to be followed these days. It is constantly inviting changes in its practice. The changes are simply done to provide a good user experience. Unlike old SEO practices which could be handled with the help of cheap backlinks and heavy keyword density, modern SEO works with a fully integrated strategy. The companies that once completely relied on their in-house Search Engine Optimizer are now out looking for a company that consists of SEO experts. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may require more than one or two SEO experts to deal with increased content demand, good backlinks, and working with Google priorities with complete knowledge of it. Whereas a good such as <a href="https://seoservicescompany.co.in/noida/">SEO company in Noida</a> can help you climb the ladders of success, on the other hand, it’s vice versa can trick you in black hat technique and leave you with less amount of traffic. While hiring a good SEO team, there is no restriction of being an expert, simply keep in mind the above 10 things and you&#8217;ll be successful in gaining a good one for your company.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>1.WHY ARE YOU APPROACHING THE SEO TEAM? WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even an SEO team can have further divisions. What all are your expectations and how would you like the team to work is one of the most important factors. Until and unless the team and you aren’t clear about the goals and procedure, you cannot proceed further. Choose a team, which would provide you: </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Technical SEO</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This team takes care of the code, site design, speed, and all the other metrics which are directly or indirectly linked to the traffic of your site. The technical SEO team ensures good and easy use of the web page to avoid any kind of user inconvenience. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li><b><i>User experience(UX)</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; It revolves around the content. An SEO expert would analyze the customer facets and improve as well as organize the content accordingly.</span></li>
 	<li><b><i>Off-page SEO</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; It means promoting your services via earning links. Strengthening the popularity of your brand is done by the SEO agency.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure while hiring the SEO agency, you confirm these three expectations from it. Also that they have a clear execution strategy ahead. Not only SEO company in Noida takes care of these three needs but explains to you its future plans for your betterment. </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14381" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.36.41-PM-300x134.png" alt="SEO agency" width="708" height="316" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> STRATEGY OF AGENCY TOWARDS YOUR GOALS</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://attrock.com/search-engine-optimization/">SEO services</a> have no universal solution. Every agency has its own ways to manage and work till the desired goals aren’t reached. As your business needs a unique execution approach to stand apart from the crowd. Since your goals are different, you would probably expect your team to work on it and find unique strategies, models, and ideas to uplift your business over the internet. SEO agency would probably cater to your goals, model, deadline, and does its best to exceed your expectations.  </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14382" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.36.50-PM.png" alt="SEO agency noida" width="449" height="438" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>3.TIME DURATION OF EXPECTED RESULTS</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact cannot be denied that <a href="https://digiperform.com/search-engine-optimization-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> takes time to display its results. This doesn’t mean that an SEO agency would set a time frame in front of you. For example, <a href="https://seoservicescompany.co.in/delhi/">SEO services in Delhi</a> take no longer than 6 months to showcase their results. The result is directly linked to the condition of your site. More traffic is directly proportional to good results. If the site is possibly well structured and free of any technical issue, you are more likely to achieve the results faster than you have thought. Question back your SEO agency to know their intentions more clearly at every point in time.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, whenever you plan a wedding, you list few of your ideas and have expectations to be followed for the occasion. You do proper analysis regarding what theme to be used for wedding, colors and so on to make it a memorable experience. Similarly, you should plan your business’ marketing strategies followed by complete analysis. To create a meaningful strategy, you need to conduct a deep level of research which is followed by competitors to have an overview of the market trends. Most businesses would rather not take the risk, especially when the information is easily available on the World Wide Web. So why would one create a <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-strategies-explode-business-2018/">digital marketing strategy</a> without a competitor analysis?</span>
<b>What is Competitor Analysis?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitor analysis is one of the strategies of digital marketing that helps to identify your competitors&#8217; values and evaluate their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to those of your own brand, product or service. It helps to gain a level of insight that allows you to evolve your digital marketing strategies based on competitor insight. It offers the complete guidance and direction to the type of activity you want to perform. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed it’s a time-consuming strategy to be followed, meaning you need to be as efficient as possible in your research; however, it’s a result-oriented. Using a competitor analysis develops to create a strategy based on complete evidence, and heading down a right path without failing and working without a cohesive plan.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxgs0jBLaIk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a marketing competitive analysis helps you:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare the topics, tactics, and channels driving market performance for you and your competitors.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncover opportunities to outperform the competition and differentiate your brand.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmark your brand against competitors, industry leaders, and market influencers.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>How to do a Competitive Analysis?</b>
<b><i>Choose the right metrics:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many marketers struggle to identify the right metrics to track their performance. Tracking your audience growth on social media and other channels allows you to determine the increases and decreases in your brand’s digital audience. By benchmarking audience growth against competitors you can spot where competitors are having a greater impact and improving your brand awareness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of marketing channels you could use in a competitive analysis:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earned media</span></li>
</ul>
<b><i>Website Audit:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most obvious part of any Competitor Analysis. At the surface level, it’s simply looking at their site, seeing what works well and what doesn’t. If a competitor has had a new website created that is easier to navigate than yours, then it is the foremost to explain why your conversions have dropped. Simultaneously, if you suddenly get a significant increase in conversions then you should seek out the answer as to why that is. The deeper level of analysis signifies things such as load times, server response times and overall website responsiveness. Ensuring every page of a website is not only responsive to different screen sizes and browsers but also friendly to them.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2herjSjceM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<b><i>Paid Search Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With search audit tools, it’s possible to find a lot of insight into the Paid Search habits of your competitors, estimate their budgets and understand the balance they strike between Paid and Organic Search. Using the same report, it can help to evaluate what keywords are valuable enough that your competitors are willing to pay money to be seen for? This audit can provide insight into what keywords are leading to conversions (sales) for your competitors.</span>
<b><i>Social Media Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As social media content continues to increase as touch points on the path to purchase across many industries, understanding what social channels are driving the most traffic is important. If a competitor is receiving a substantial amount of social traffic from Facebook, one should know what types of content they’re posting and how frequently.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14374" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BuzzSumo-1024x574-300x168.png" alt="Social Media Audit" width="716" height="401" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the vast area where it is difficult to analyze without certain digital marketing tools. On the deeper side of the analysis, you can look at large amounts of data to ascertain levels of engagement of their fan base, whether it appears they are using certain strategies and if there are useful findings such as optimum posting times for your target demographics that you could apply to your social media strategy.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEViF6tTqG4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<b><i>SEO/Keywords Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying Keywords that are common to you and your competitors is key to succeed in this competitive strategy. Unfortunately, there will be times when you simply may not be able to rank for a keyword you want to organically but on the flip side, you can focus on gaining those keywords you already show dominance in. Having a thorough understanding of the Keyword terms targeted by your competitors along with maps of their search traffic will help inform both your own Organic and Paid Search strategy going forward. It is also once again an indicator of how seriously they take their Digital Marketing and the strategies they are employing. The key to strategic insight is the range of data looked at and the depth of the analysis. It is simple to see what Keywords your competitors are ranking for now.</span>
<b><i><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14376" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cc-300x165.jpg" alt="SEO/Keywords Audit" width="691" height="380" /></i></b>
<b><i>Local Presence</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of local search terms such as ‘near-me’ have been well documented but even without them, local searches make up a huge portion of product/service based search terms. Knowing whether your competitors are taking full advantage of all of the Local Directory Listings lets you know where there could be yet more easy wins.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13041" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2.3-300x189.png" alt="Local Presence" width="390" height="246" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of businesses know by now that they should have claimed and completed their Google My Business (used to be Google Places) listings. Surprisingly very, very few business have engaged in any strategy to ensure their reviews are linked to these listings. A comprehensive review of all Local Directories will show where your competitors have left gaps that you can take advantage of in as little as a few minutes.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are many tools such as <em>SimilarWeb, Google Advanced Search Operators, SEMRush, Google Alerts</em> etc that you can utilize to track the performance and digital marketing strategies of your top competitors.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days social media is not only for creating social profiles, posting, tweeting, sharing videos &amp; memes; it plays a role in business and marketing as well. More than <em>25% of the total time spent online on social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, etc. and 60% of buying online occurs based on the reviews</em> that are seen on social media. If we talk about Facebook alone which is one of the highly used social media platforms, has more than <em>2.6 billion monthly active users</em>. This is why any businesses should consider advertising through Facebook post and other social media marketing sites to explode their businesses. It’s a great opportunity for a company to make online sales, get a following around the brand, create a platform where customers can discuss the products and services, when done successfully, let people spread the word about the brand’s qualities.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14111" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fb2-300x169.png" alt="Facebook Monthly Users" width="696" height="392" />
<b><i>More facts about Facebook:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-1.55 billion people on average log onto Facebook daily and are considered daily active users for September 2017, which represents a 16 percent increase year over year.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Facebook users are 76% female (out of 100% of all females) and 66% male (out of 100% of all males).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Highest traffic occurs mid-week between 1 to 3 pm.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-42% of marketers report that Facebook is critical or important to their business.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These facts give an idea about how Facebook can bring wonders in the business promotions. Creating the Facebook business page and boosting it will help to increase brand awareness, brand engagement, promoting new content and blogs. The Companies are spending money to boost their business’ pages with a specific goal in place to bring out the right visibility and brand awareness through social media mediums. For those who still are not having an idea, what we are discussing here, let’s have an overview then:</span>
<b>What is Boosting a Post or Page?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Facebook and various other social media platforms, you find a Boost Button which allows you to create a Facebook ad quickly using your post or page. This ad appears in different places on Facebook as a Sponsored Ad. Boosting a post from your business Page is a quick and easy way to show your content to people who might be interested.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A boosted post is a post from your business Page (chargeable), can appear higher up on your audience’s News Feeds. The fee depends on how many people you want the post to reach, the number of days you want to select, and the payment depends on the number of impressions the post gets with time.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14112" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fb3-300x174.png" alt="number of impressions" width="671" height="389" />
<b>Which Facebook Page should Boost?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since your page may have many posts and contents, choose the post which can deliver or have potential to deliver high ROI. In short, choose the content with the highest ROI value. Also, you can boost the informative content that can create brand awareness for a longer run. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a rule of thumb, a post worth boosting also satisfies the following criteria:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps promote a product or service offered by your business</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It encourages visits to your business’s website</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It spreads awareness of a limited-time campaign your business is running</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure it should comply with Facebook guidelines. </span></li>
</ul>

<b><i>Find the best time to boost a post</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time plays the key role in your marketing strategy. When to boost or when not to. It is the major factor to keep in mind when boosting a post. For companies that have been actively running a Facebook account are well aware or know how the boosted post runs, what days and times their audience is online should be common knowledge. For companies that have yet to determine Post Boosting, it helps to test out posting at various times of the week to get a feel for when their users are most active, and when they are not.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once companies have figured out the best time to boost a post, they should focus boosting activity at these times to increase its effectiveness. You can adjust the timings for your ads through Facebook Ad manager. </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14113" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fb4-300x184.png" alt="Facebook Ad manager" width="658" height="404" />
<b><i>Maximize Targeting Options</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to boost a post but it’s hard to boost it effectively. The key lies in whom you are targeting and how. Based on the goal, companies have the ability to target anyone they want on Facebook. When boosting a post, Facebook offers the following targeting options:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest</span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_14114" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14114" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14114" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fb5-149x300.png" alt="Targeting Audience" width="413" height="832" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-14114" class="wp-caption-text">Facebook Post Boost is applicable for all currencies.</figcaption></figure>

<b><i>Include specifications for your Target Market:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to decide what’s the goal for your every post when you set up them to boost. You may want to reach users that are engaged and looking for a wedding photographer, or maybe you want to reach who are looking for travel packages. As stated earlier, Facebook allows you to use specifications such as age, gender, location, language, and relationship status to reach your target clients. For example, if most of your audiences come from a certain location or area, refine your boost to that location.</span>
<b><i><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14057" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dashboard-google-analytics-social-media-web-performance-300x202.png" alt="Target Market" width="661" height="445" /></i></b>
<b><i>Share Compelling Content:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided the specifics of your target market, you can then decide what type of content you would like to share with them which can add benefit and should be result oriented. The benefit of limiting the recipients of the boosted post is that you will be able to share content that is specific to that group of people. If you have content that you want to share but it may not be the best for a custom audience you have already set up, consider creating a new custom audience to see if it gains more interaction.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14115" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fb-ad-300x180.png" alt="Share Compelling Content" width="636" height="382" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook is a great social media tool and can be used with other Social Media platforms as well. Facebook Boost Post provides massive market and by following aforesaid tips, you can utilize it effectively for your business as well.</span>

How can you explode your business with digital marketing strategies?</span>
<b><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13974" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/blog-300x169.png" alt="Digital Marketing Strategies" width="646" height="364" /></b>
<b>What is Digital Marketing?</b>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing is a set of online marketing tools and strategies that help to promote your brand and generate the leads through digital mediums.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Promoting a brand plays a big role in generating leads and digital marketing helps to sustain at very limited cost.</span>
<b>What is Digital Marketing Strategies?</b>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.in/backup/digital-marketing-strategies-implementation-businesses/">Digital marketing strategy</a> is the series of actions that help to achieve business goals using online marketing.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The term ‘strategy’ may sound intimidating, but building an effective digital strategy is not that difficult as people suspect.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple terms, a strategy is just a plan of action to achieve the desired goal or multiple goals. For example, your overarching goal might be to generate 25% more leads via your website this year than you drove last year.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the scale of your business, your digital marketing strategy may involve multiple goals and a lot of moving parts, but coming back to this simple way of thinking about digital marketing strategy can help you stay focused on meeting those objectives. In this article, we will discuss few digital marketing strategies that will help you in achieving business goals through digital mediums. </span>
<b><i>Set A Goal:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to grow your business and get connected with more customers, more recognition or maybe you’re looking to get ahead of the competition. Whatever the case may be, starting with a planned goal in mind greatly increases your chances of success. Digital marketing is a great way for small businesses to prosper, but going into the process blindly will leave you in a jumbled mess. A lot of strategy and precision goes into digital marketing where having a goal helps you know what to focus on.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14076" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/goals-300x200.png" alt="Digital Marketing Goals" width="540" height="360" />
<b><i>Audience:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to drive the right traffic to your online store and increase sales, you first need to determine and analyze what a qualified audience is for your brand. You should know who they are, what they value and how they use each channel at the various stages of their purchase journey, from interest and validation through to decision and advocacy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As marketers and businessmen, they have limited access to data. Google Analytics and Search Console can tell us how people find your store and what they do upon arriving. Whereas social media tools like Facebook Insights and Ad Manager can tell us the age, location, relationship status, interests and behaviors of our fans and customers. Other social media listening tools can tell us what customers think about the brand and products, and what other topics are interesting to them.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use these tools to unearth insights about your audience’s demographic and psychographic profiles to gain a better understanding of what is most important and interesting.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tckbTQEz9GM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<b><i>Local Search Marketing:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to study, 50% of people go to the store or business they searched for within a day of that search. Additionally, 60% of people have made use of the information they found on local online ads and on a business&#8217;s website. This includes website optimization for search results, which integrates a search engine&#8217;s function of maps. This is especially true with Google, where your business can be listed with mapping and address information, giving a prospective customer what they need to visit your establishment. The emphasis on trying to reach customers, often long-time, loyal customers, in the business&#8217;s local area is at the heart of local marketing.</span>
<b><i><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13043" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/digiperform-local-listing-300x272.png" alt="Local Search Marketing" width="518" height="470" /></i></b>
<b><i>Content Marketing:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy revolves around giving a prospective customer who wants to have the glimpse of your product or service, as well as information in general. Everyone is trying to sell, but those who are transparent are more likely to get sales. People will attribute a certain level of expertise to a company, and this instills confidence in the consumer. Content marketing in the best way done with printed brochures, blogs, and guidebooks, to provide specific information through online medium.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14077" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Content-Marketing-Model-300x199.png" alt="Content Marketing Model" width="612" height="406" />
<b><i>Social Media Marketing:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone talks about social media, however, it can be difficult for companies to integrate social media with their business. The type of media used, as well how it is used, is dependent upon the type of business you have. For some companies being in touch with their customers, reciprocating the concerns and giving them breaking news can be an important element of success.
