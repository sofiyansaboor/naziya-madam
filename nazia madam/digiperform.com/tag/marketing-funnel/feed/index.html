The visual stage-specific content will help to qualify, nurture, and convert visitors or leads into paying customers.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are still figuring out what this marketing funnel all about? How content marketing relates to traditional marketing funnel? How does this content marketing funnel works? What are the content marketing stages? How you can use to create your own marketing strategies for businesses? Then the answers to your all questions lie here. Let&#8217;s dig out the one by one to understand it in better. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What is Marketing Sales Funnel?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing sales funnel commonly known as </span><b>Sales Funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>Revenue Funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consists of the following stages:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awareness</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decision</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Brand awareness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feeds the top of the funnel through various mediums like TV, newspapers, word to mouth, pamphlets, radios, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You let your audience/people moving through the funnel by getting them </span><b>interested</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through awareness. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you make them interested, they make a </span><b>decision</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and takes the </span><b>Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/marketing-funnels.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class=" wp-image-18841 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/marketing-funnels.png" alt="" width="453" height="453" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A funnel that has a low conversion rate which is why it is called a “</span><b>leaky funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Where the leak takes place in those four stages tells marketers or businessmen to what layer of the funnel needs work on. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big problem with the traditional sales funnel is that it really doesn’t address how modern consumers and make them buy.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, when it comes to content marketing funnel, the marketers or companies don’t know how to create content? How content marketing, as well as companies, can come together and work like one? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers ask questions like:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many blog posts should I write?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How often should I be tweeting every day?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a specific percentage of my budget that I should be spending on video?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I really need to write white papers and ebooks?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">So, what is Content Marketing Funnel?</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose to generate various kind of content is to convert visitors into actual customers. The same been is encouraged by a content marketing funnel which is a system that helps to convert as many leads into customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through step by step content flow, the marketer can gain as many as potential customers to pay for your products or services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales funnel has a major flaw that there are chances people are your leads or potential customers, however, there are fewer chances they would actually buy your product due to leakage. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The leakage is there are chances that as potential customers move through the funnel towards the much narrower neck (as mentioned in the picture), many will drop off.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome this leakage, the content marketing funnel has made a little variation in the actual sales marketing funnel. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Its basic agenda is to make sure the smaller number of leads will actually make it through the entire funnel and become paying customers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A content marketing funnel has three broad stages:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Awareness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – when a lead or visitor first discovers your brand </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Evaluation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – when a qualified lead (or potential customer) decides to find out whether your product or service is the right fit or not</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Purchase</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – this is the stage every business desperately wants to achieve when the prospect gathers the last bit of information they need before deciding to buy and becomes a customer.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there should be another stage that every marketer or business should dare to achieve which can be clubbed as the fourth stage in the funnel i.e., </span><b>Happy Customers.</b>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18840 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Happy Customers</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses consider sales/conversion as the last stage of marketing funnel which is absolutely wrong. </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales may seem the ultimate goal but the strong and happy customer relationship is the foundation of any business. </span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the marketer should believe in this stage of the funnel and put more focus on Happy Customers than awareness and consideration. They will directly go to conversion especially when it comes to small businesses.  </span>
<h4><em><strong>Don’t agree, let’s take a look:</strong></em></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In your marketing plans, you have only or around 5% chance to sell your product or services to a new customer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you have an existing happy customer, there are 60-70% chance to sell the same product or services to a repeat customer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree every business needs to work on to get new customers. However, your marketing strategy should be designed in such a way where you can target your new audience as well remarket your happy customers again.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been stated that 65% or more of a small business’ revenues come in through existing customers. You agree or not, a little 5% reduction in customer defection can increase revenues by 100%.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketers as well businesses need to work on strategies where they can target to retain their old customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, only 32% of companies are trying to retain their customer. Rest yet need to focus on that. Competition is serious. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What type of Content Goes with Content Marketing Funnel?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the real question arises: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of content belongs at which stage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the answer to your query in a simple way. We have shared different examples to signify which type of content belongs to which stage. Have a look!</span>
