										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost motive of any content marketing strategy is to captivate the target audience, educate them and convert them into customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, no wonder, all the content creators give their heart and soul to create such kind of unique and valuable content that definitely helps businesses to achieve their end goals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kudos to all the content creators!</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, who has less idea what is content marketing all about, we are here to help. </span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free beginner’s guide to content marketing</a>, we have been sharing basic elements related to content marketing, especially for beginners. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, we have shared:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How content marketing plays an important role in a business success? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various ways to create a content marketing strategy? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is content marketing related to marketing funnel? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to identify your audience for content marketing strategy? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various tools that can help you generate effective content for the same?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all these efforts won’t give desired results if none of these have appropriate Call-to-Action (CTA) triggers. Yes, you have read right!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, if your motive to share the content is to bring visitors to the website, then you will use a trigger (CTA) to land your audience to your websites. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Same way, whenever you receive an email stating any shopping sale, you might have noticed </span><b>Call-to-Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing to the website or app. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These action buttons help target audience to land upon the right designated path and give you the successful campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this chapter of beginner’s guide to content marketing, we will be sharing how Call-to-Actions play an important role in any content marketing success. What are the basic steps you need to keep in mind while creating the content? How to create a compelling call-to-action for your content marketing strategy?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-19066 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/call-to-actions.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="254" /></span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have stated earlier, Call-to-action helps to captivate the target audience as well as increase the conversions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not all the call-to-action can give you the success rate.  Most of the content marketers aren’t using effective CTAs to target the ideal audience and convert them as happy customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look into business website stats, only 30% of businesses are using appropriate CTAs to engage their ideal customers. Rest, 70% of business sites lack call-to-action. This is devastating. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our content creators aka marketers need to understand the importance of CTAs in their marketing strategy and how they (CTAs) help them to increase their open as well as success rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging a prospect to take desired actions as per your marketing strategy may seem the hardest task for marketers, but is not unachievable. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to create informative content for your readers that can solve their problems and serve your purpose. You need to focus on creating a beautiful attractive content design and more &amp; more powerful as well as compelling Call-to-Action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers look for easy and understandable </span><b>Clickable Button</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than a confusing action. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are CTAs?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call-to-Action</a> which are the clickable buttons basically used on your website, landing pages, emails, blogs, etc to guide your readers or visitors towards your goal conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the part of your content that the user needs to click in order to take the action you want them to take.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the question comes, why marketers fail to convert readers to customers. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does wrong in creating a compelling call to action? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What goes into a strong CTA? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the basic things you need to keep in mind while creating an effective CTA for your marketing strategy?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s read further: </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Choose a Goal:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, decide why you need to CTA and what are your purpose to use the following CTA? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should your call to action button is to generate webinar sign-ups or you want your readers to download the ebook? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your audience to share your content or want to land up to your website? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason can be any…..</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, decide your goal and write your appropriate CTA based on your content strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, of course, use the desired actionable link so that the reader can the desired action with minimal hassle.</span>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Consider the Context:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the place of your reader or prospect in the current marketing cycle. Does your reader knows about your product already or it’s the first time that you have introduced your services to them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it won’t make a sense if your reader is landing for the first time on your homepage to get a CTA about buying an expensive product. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, understand the level and accordingly set your CTA. For example, if you are selling some audio product, in such case, use CTA as “Request a Demo” or “Learn More” instead of using “Buy Now”.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-19070 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/calltoaction-example.png" alt="" width="575" height="362" />
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Make to Short &amp; Precise:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember on the golden rule of using CTAs. Using multiple calls to actions buttons in one piece of content can ruin the whole information, lower your conversion rate and confuse your readers as well. Also, wordy CTAs can get easily ignored. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use short and precise CTAs to make your content more effective. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days our readers are more knowledgeable and understand that a hyperlink or button is intended to click. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, Instead of guiding them saying “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here to register for our free webinar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”; use or state “</span><b><i>Register for our free webinar</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which is likely to have a stronger impact.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Place CTA Strategically:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While creating valuable content, the marketer should know where to place the CTA in the content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always recommended not to use CTA in the middle of your content, that probably will confuse your readers and distract them from your valuable content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always place a call to action at the end of the content body when the message of your content is delivered. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2></h2>
<h1><b>How to create a compelling call to action?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content creators invest a lot of time in generating problem-solving content for their readers or give ultimate efforts into your online marketing strategy, but they forget to give focus on research of appropriate Call-to-Actions which led to less conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are getting traffic on your content but no conversions, then this is the high time to look into your “How to club perfect CTA in the content” strategy. </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are few tips to create a compelling call to action for your content.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Direct</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop looking for indirect ways to convert your audience. State clearly what is the purpose of sharing the content. Stop beating around the bush.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your content / your website / your business is valuable that should be in direct in approach. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be precise and tell your visitors what you do and what exactly you would like them to do.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Call to Action must be simple, short and strong.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure there is no room to play guessing games for your visitors or readers to get confused or clueless. Use straightforward examples in a positive way like ‘get started,’ ‘sign up,’ ‘submit,’ or ‘download’.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Unique</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a marketer, you already aware how it is crucial to be unique and stand different in the crowd if you want to beat the competition. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find something that makes your call-to-action special; it could be ridiculously simple or something that aggravates a problem.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Use Actionable Language</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use action words that compel or motivate your visitors to do what you want them to. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, “</span><b><i>Call us today for a free sample</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” will make them curious to have or try at least Free sample which seems a good call to take an action. You are giving clear direction to the reader using the action-  “Call”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other ways, you can say like “Give us a call for a free demo”  but it seems less actionable then previous one. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Urgent</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CTAs you use in your content must create the urgency so that visitors take the action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The agenda is to convey the message that your readers are missing out the great opportunity that should be theirs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like one example we have used earlier. “Call us today for a free sample” denoted more urgency instead of “Give us a call for a free demo”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Call us today create the urgency that they can miss out the great deal to use the free sample or demo than later one stating or requesting to give a call for the free demo. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both have a slight difference but the way you approach matter a lot in your CTAs. While “today” is a good word to add in your call to action, using “now” or “immediately” is even better. These words imply a greater urgency and also make it clear that the offer may not last forever.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Call-to-Action Example</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Netflix</b></span></h2>
<b>CTA Button: Join Free for a Month</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19065 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-15-at-11.09.56-PM.png" alt="" width="555" height="347" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever a new user feels to sign up any new program, he/she fears to commit as it will be the pain to cancel their subscription if they end up not liking it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix has been running various campaigns stating not to fear to cancel the subscription by saying “Cancel Anytime” along with “Join Free for a Month&#8221; CTA with full assurance. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This assurance alone has boosted unlimited sign-ups where you notice that the red color of the primary and secondary CTAs here match Netflix&#8217;s logo color.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bravo!</span>
&nbsp;
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an effective call-to-action takes creativity, time, practice and lots of research.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that it needs to be simple enough so that users can easily understand your message.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the content and CTA should be compelling enough to persuade them to do what you want them to do.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, don’t feel afraid to be experimental and see what works best for your audience.</span>
