										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has no limits and boundaries. This has been clearly manifested by our one of the trainees in Mumbai &#8211; </span><b>Sana Shaikh</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is a full stack developer by profession and a complete marketer by passion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During her developer days, she believed that her career has not been limited to just developing. She could be a developer, marketer, strategist and many more. She never wanted to limit herself to just one role. All-rounder!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She has believed that one should go along with the current trend where she realized digital marketing is the new trend. With the zeal to get master in this new version of marketing, she joined Digiperform’s </span><b>dCDMC &#8211; <a href="https://digiperform.com/certified-digital-marketing-consultant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital marketing course</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and started incorporating learning in her <a href="https://digiperform.com/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital marketing strategies</a>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a chit-chat session, we decided to ask how her journey has been so far and how Digiperform played its role.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s read more&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: It’s a pleasure to connect with you! Before heading further, we would like to know a bit about you.</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: Hi, I am Sana Shaikh, an engineer by education and a full stack developer by profession. Also, I believe, I’m a marketer by passion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: What originally attracted you to choose digital marketing as your career?</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: I have always been very keen on keeping myself updated about the latest trends whether it&#8217;s an online marketing, technology or fashion. Being a developer for 4 years, I realized that I have always wanted to get out of my comfort zone and needed to break the bubble of limited engineering profile.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I discovered the other parameters of business and felt an utter need to step out of my space where I could deal directly with the clients’ business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with that, I have had deep thurst where I could use my analytical and presentation skills directly in front of the clients rather than playing the side roll in the development. </span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the same zeal, I decided to go out of the box which is demanding in the current scenario and raise my skill, my bar. This eagerness led me to learn digital marketing and be part of this creative or innovative field. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: What exactly that makes us stand out from the competition &amp; urge you to choose us over others?</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: The most important thing I liked about Digiperform that they provide live classroom training sessions. Most of the institutes provide online sessions only which I feel not sufficient enough if you want to learn anything. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Classroom training is the USP of Digiperform.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: Tell us about your favorite experience you had with us, whether as a learner or as a customer?</b></span><b>
</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: During training, I  liked how they have provided and discussed live case studies that really helping me to use the knowledge to help my clients grow their brands/businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b></b>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</b></span><b>
</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: Yes, I would like to recommend Digiperform as the trusted &amp; reliable source for digital marketing learning because of their quality of curriculum and training. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They make sure each student learn everything about digital marketing and get satisfied with the training.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b></b>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: If you were to review our training program, what score would you give it out of 10?</b></span><b>
</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: I would like to rate 8 out of 10.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b></b>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?</b></span><b>
</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: I have future plans for working as a freelancer for international clients as well set up my own digital marketing agency.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b></b>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: If you had a piece of advice to someone just starting out, what would it be?</b></span><b>
</b></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: I would like to suggest trainees invest their time in research various concepts and do practicals accordingly. Money can be earned back but time can’t. Trust your instincts and believe in your mentors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: Finally, Describe Digiperform in one line.</b></span><b>
</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sana: An institution that really cares for its students future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks, Sana for sharing your valuable feedback. We wish you a great success in your future endeavors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

<h4><strong>Digiperform- Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ravi- </strong></span>Definitely, the content of the modules is great and provides you complete practical exposure to outshine.
<h4><strong>Digiperform-  If you were to review our training program, what score would you give it out of 10?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ravi-</strong> 7 out of 10</span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform- Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ravi- </strong></span>I would like to continue my <a href="https://digiperform.com/work-freelancer-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career in freelancing</a> and see myself as an influencer working for top-notch companies.
<h4><strong>Digiperform- If you had a piece of advice to someone just starting out, what would it be?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ravi- </strong></span>Stay aware of latest trends, and always be open to learning.
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Digiperform- Finally, Describe Digiperform in one line.</strong> </span></h4>
