			<p>You might have read or heard that AI plays a vital role in digital marketing, and now you’re wondering what AI is and how exactly it benefits your marketing strategies?</p>
<p>Well, you’re in luck, because in this article, I’ll be answering precisely those questions. I’ll briefly explain what AI is, what its uses are, and what benefits it gives.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
<p>To put it simply, artificial intelligence refers to an intelligence showcased by machines that imitate cognitive functions performed by humans. That’s the technical description, it boils down to the program being able to learn and analyze certain patterns. Let’s simplify it by understanding what it can do. This includes problem-solving, data analysis, language translation, speech recognition, data analysis, and learning. AI has already been widely used in marketing.</p>
<p>Take an example from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108211218/https://www.amazon.in/">Amazon</a>. They use AI to show only relevant products to individual shoppers based on their previous searches, views, and purchases. This increases the chance of a shopper to make a repeat purchase. Now, this method is used by other eCommerce companies.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at other ways AI can be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7 Ways You Can Use AI in Your Digital Marketing Plan</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. AI-Powered Logo Maker</h4>
<p>One of the unique ways AI is used goes back to the beginning of website making. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108211218/https://zyro.com/logo-maker">AI-powered logo maker</a> helps new webmasters or business owners who are operating on a tight budget by generating a logo based on their preferences.</p>
<p>This work is usually a few different canvases with the basic design, which the user can then customize to their liking, from its shape, fonts, and colors. Once done, they just need to hit the submit button, and the logo is generated automatically. You can even download them in high resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Product Recommendations</h4>
<p>Many eCommerce brands use AI to track their customers’ habits, buying behavior, and preferences. This is to help them make suggestions on other products that their customers might be interested in to assist in scaling up sales and revenue growth.</p>
<p>AI can do data analysis far quicker and more accurately than humans. It collects and analyzes details of past interactions with your business and uses other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108211218/https://www.sisense.com/analytics-tools/">analytics tools</a> to go through massive amounts of data and give you powerful insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Chatbot</h4>
<p>AI chatbots have enabled businesses to go from the traditional<b> one-to-one</b> approach to a <b>one-to-many</b> approach, giving multiple customers support at once. This is due to the development of language processing, voice conversion, and semantic recognition technology.</p>
<p>One significant advantage of AI chatbots is that they don’t need rest, allowing them to answer customer queries 24/7. This, in turn, improves customer experience. Additionally, customers can also choose the language to communicate with the AI chatbots, hence delivering localized customer service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Web Design</h4>
<p>The existence of AI in web design allows anyone to be able to create a great website. It takes all of the necessary coding requirements. It turns it into a website builder where customers can simply choose a template and customize every element using multiple tools.</p>
<p>Not only customize each element, but AI can also help users generate content for their new site. All they need to do is place a few keywords on the AI content generator, and it will create content based on those words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. Market Analysis</h4>
<p>AI covers a massive area of marketing analytics, from automated decision management to social media analytics. AI merges diverse data sources to figure out the patterns and predict future results.</p>
<p>AI makes the job of marketing analysts much easier. Using analytic tools like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108211218/https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a>, you can create more meaningful outcomes and pump insights in real-time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>6. Email Marketing</h4>
<p>Like chatbots, AI in email marketing allows for a <b>one-to-many</b> approach when sending personalized emails by basing it on user behaviors.</p>
<p>Not only that but AI also helps marketers optimize their email campaigns by using tools like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108211218/https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>. It dynamically analyzes and optimizes campaigns quickly by analyzing your past campaigns and merging it with existing customer behavior to create a fitting plan that is flexible to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. Marketing Content</h4>
<p>You can now discover which content is most useful to use for marketing, thanks to the AI’s analysis of your target audience’s behavior. Marketers can now understand what type of content works for an audience and how to segment different audiences with different pieces.</p>
<p>Based on AI statistics, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108211218/https://serpwatch.io/blog/content-marketing-statistics/">40% of millennials trust video content more</a> than other types. Thus marketers should focus more on video content.</p>
<p>AI can also curate and create content. Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108211218/https://www.youtube.com/?gl=IN">Youtube</a>’s recommendation system that gives suggestions for videos based on the user’s previous behavior, it can also be applied to suggest blogs, videos, and other forms of content that can interest a user when visiting your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Benefits of AI-Powered Digital Marketing for Your Business</h3>
<p>Tapping into AI’s potential makes it easier for your business to stay on top with the latest marketing trends and remain competitive. With that said, here are some other benefits of AI-powered digital marketing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Greater Audience Targeting</h4>
<p>AI lets you analyze data so you can predict the buying behavior of your target audience. Using data from sources like online transactions and internet cookies is a great place to start. Your AI can help highlight <b>Unique Selling Point</b> that set your business apart from competitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Improved Customer Experience</h4>
<p>Looking at AI’s uses for digital marketing above, I can say that AI’s purpose intersects with user experience. AI helps tailor your content based on a more profound understanding of customer motivations and behaviors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Better Content Delivery on Social Media</h4>
<p>Since AI can track your target audience’s preferences and behavior, you can use the data and incorporate it into your social media marketing.</p>
<p>After the AI has identified your potential customers, you can know when is the most effective time to post relevant content. By continuously making content pertinent to your audience using that method, you can increase your social media campaigns’ success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Dynamic Pricing</h4>
<p>Providing discounts is a guaranteed way to boost sales, but some customers are willing to buy with smaller or no discounts at all.</p>
<p>By using AI, you can set the discount percentage based on demand, availability, customer profiles, and other factors so you can maximize both your sales and profits.</p>
<p>Take an example of when searching for a flight ticket. One day you go and search for a flight but don’t decide to buy it that day. Then you come back a couple of days later to find that the price has gone up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>You know now the uses of AI along with some of its benefits. All that’s left to do now is to apply the help of AI to your digital marketing strategies and watch as you get the benefits from it. Remember that an AI is only as good as the data you feed it, so make sure to provide it with an in-depth and massive amount of data, and they’ll do the work for you.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that you could make a machine that acts with intelligence dates back to the civilizations of Ancient Greece, China, and India. Various attempts have been made over the centuries to bring this idea to life (one particularly amusing example was the creation of a mechanical duck).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, true artificial intelligence had to wait for the invention of the digital computer, specifically one of its modern incarnations, the neural network. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Neural networks use a process called machine learning to learn how to discover patterns in data, which enables them to generate output similar (or sometimes superior) to that of a human being. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning AI is now being used to solve problems across multiple industries, including healthcare, military, finance, news, and even digital marketing. According to a recent digital marketing survey, AI is poised to completely </span><a href="https://www.demandbase.com/press-release/marketing-executives-predict-artificial-intelligence-will-revolutionize-marketing-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transform the marketing landscape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2020.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AI-digital-marketing.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-23875 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AI-digital-marketing.jpg" alt="AI &amp; digital marketing" width="669" height="250" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to know more about the various ways in which <em>AI is being used in digital marketing</em>, check out our short primer on the topic in the remainder of this post.</span>
<h2><strong>AI and Personalization</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized experiences are a key component of modern digital marketing. Generic, mass-produced content is no longer effective at generating consumer interest due to years of constant exposure. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized content, on the other hand, has been correlated with higher revenue, stronger brand loyalty, and overall better customer experiences. Personalized digital marketing campaigns are now easier to implement than ever thanks to AI. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One prominent example includes AI-powered suggestion algorithms used Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and many others. By connecting their customer database to an AI, these companies can synthesize various kinds of data, from visitor on-site behavior, purchase history, reviews, ratings, etc. to provide personalized product suggestions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way in which AI is helping with personalization is through audience targeting and segmentation. Solutions such as </span><a href="https://limespot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limespot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://vue.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vue.ai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are giving small and mid-sized businesses a way to create personalized <a href="https://digiperform.com/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing strategies</a> and campaigns on a budget.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>AI and Customer Service</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer service in the digital era is built around providing timely, relevant responses to customer queries. Failing to respond at a moment’s notice is likely to generate a negative experience, reducing the likelihood of a conversion. This is a tough challenge to overcome. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you drastically expand your customer service department, you likely won’t be able to satisfy customer demand.  Or at least that was the case until customer service chatbots became a reality. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you probably know by now, chatbots </span><a href="https://servisbot.com/rfp-template-chatbots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are special programs created for conversation-based tasks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They can engage with website visitors, answer common questions, offer product recommendations, place orders, and more.</span>
<h2><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ai-role-in-chatbots.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23876 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ai-role-in-chatbots.jpg" alt="ai role in chatbots" width="552" height="368" /></a></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>AI and Data Analysis</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing thrives on actionable data, and thanks to developments in AI, marketers now have the tools they need to take data analysis to the next level. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, AI tools like <strong>Adtext</strong> can analyze ad performance across different marketing channels and determine which ones resonate the most with each specific audience, allowing you to get a better ROI for your ads. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example would be AI in email automation, where their ability to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">discover relevant content topics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, headings, time for sending, and sending frequency really comes to shine. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is also being used to track marketing campaign performance in real-time, which again allows marketers to determine things like the lowest price-per-click on the fly. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the analysis potential of AI is being leveraged for procedural content generation, which makes them useful for creating personalized <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing</a>.</span>
<h2><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artificial-intelligence-email-marketing-adidas-example-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-23877 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artificial-intelligence-email-marketing-adidas-example-1.png" alt="artificial-intelligence-email-marketing-adidas-example (1)" width="419" height="1405" /></a></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>AI and Data Mining</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an economy driven by information such as ours, data is a highly valuable commodity. Without quality data, running a modern business operation is nigh impossible, to say nothing of running a digital marketing campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, in addition to being driven by data, AI can also be used for acquiring it in a systematic fashion. </span><a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/data-mining-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data-mining AI tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can extract large volumes of data from different sources, organize the material according to dynamically-generated or predetermined patterns, and pipe it through directly to marketers for immediate use. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They can then create laser-focused digital marketing campaigns in a fraction of the time it would have taken them just a few years ago. And the longer these AI systems mine data, the better they become at it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Insights gained from through AI data mining has led to the fulfillment of a long-standing marketing dream – possessing total information about each prospect, making conversions all but guaranteed.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>AI and Competitor Analytics</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern businesses need to pursue every advantage available to place themselves ahead of competitors. And, one of the most direct ways to gain leverage over someone is to possess information on them. This kind of information used to be difficult to come by. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can spend all the time in the world analyzing what competitors are doing on the surface, but finding the motives behind their behavior is a different matter. That is until you bring AI into the picture. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitive intelligence AI tools such as </span><a href="https://www.karna.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karna AI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> combine data gathering and analysis features to synthesize insights about rivals. By constantly keeping watch of what your competitors are publishing online, which audiences they’re targeting, and how they’re responding to trends, you can adjust your digital marketing strategy accordingly.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>AI and Customer Relationship Management</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://project-management.com/top-5-crm-management-software/">CRM software</a> is a staple of modern digital business. It is used to coordinate customer data coming from multiple channels, including email, social media, website, mobile, and others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CRM tools allow companies to automate their marketing and sales workflow by eliminating tedious busy work that comes with managing a large customer base. Modern CRM products such as </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SalesForce CRM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have taken things a step further by adding AI to their platform. Also they have <a href="https://www.zonkafeedback.com/guides/salesforce-surveys">salesforce feedback management</a> system.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This so-called Einstein AI is used for gauging customer disposition based on data provided, and it can then make automatic adjustments to digital marketing campaigns. This helps marketing teams by leaving the tedious parts of marketing work to the AI so that they can focus on more creative parts of their job.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">AI technology is in the process of transforming the whole digital industry, including marketing. With its automation and data-processing capabilities, AI has the potential to reshape digital marketing through fully automated, personalized, data-driven campaigns. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to AI. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, digital marketing as such might become a domain run entirely by machines. So, the sooner you adapt to using AI for digital marketing, the better prepared you will be for the inevitable rise of machines.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.thirdwatch.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thirdwatch</a> is an Artificial Intelligence driven company based in Gurgaon started by two tech wizards &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shashank Agarwal and Adarsh Jain. Lets read more about the company and how they are helping to detect real-time frauds in the e-commerce market. </span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Please share about your company?</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ThirdWatch is an Artificial Intelligence driven startup based in Gurgaon. Thirdwatch aims to reduce fraud that occurs in digital transactions through AI and machine learning. Its platform Mitra prevents fraud in digital, banking and e-commerce transactions in real time by integrating AI. Its system captures 200+ parameters and flags each transaction in real time, as red or green. It generates a risk score also which defines riskiness of the transaction. These days companies have little choice and fewer tools to prevent Fraud- they consider it as a ‘cost of doing business’.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most firms resort to blunt static rules like blocking all International credit cards, not delivering to certain pin codes and cities, or capping the order size. These macro-level rules cause more harm than they do good, as many genuine orders get lost and customer relationships are damaged. ThirdWatch has solved this challenge by replacing manual rules with an AI platform, Mitra which performs automatic screening of all orders and does not reject genuine orders. </span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Who are the founders and co-founders of the company?</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdwatch was started in April 2016 by Shashank Agarwal and Adarsh Jain, who had the first-hand experience of the issues e-commerce businesses face.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of years back, Adarsh was trying to order a TV for his father who resides in Greater Noida, from one of the top 2 e-commerce sites in India. However, the website refused to confirm the order despite being prepaid. When he ordered the same item to his Gurgaon address, it came through. After digging deeper into this issue, we found that fraud/abuse is a colossal problem in e-commerce, costing online businesses huge revenue losses. To deal with the issue, companies have to induce broad rules like blocking certain pin codes/cities/states and/or international credit from ordering, which unfortunately affect genuine users as well.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given their experience in building Big Data mobile analytics system, they felt confident that they can solve this problem by using AI and machine learning.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adarsh and Shashank have previously worked together and know each other from past 6 years. In their last assignment, they created a Mobile analytics system </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ROCQ,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was a huge success in terms of clients and multiple acquisition offers. They have also filed several patents, which made them confident enough to start ThirdWatch. They have raised funding when they were just two members of the team and they are confident that this team will grow at a tremendous rate.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>What role does it play in E-commerce industry? How can e-commerce businessman flag risky transactions and prevent loss?</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud has become a common nuisance for the entire ecosystem of e-commerce which comprises of merchants, marketplace aggregator, and customer. E-commerce sellers are constantly facing different kinds of frauds and abuses, like RTOs, chargeback frauds, and promo code abuse among others. Smart e-commerce businesses rely on technology to find the best fraud prevention solution for them and save a large amount of revenue and inventory that would otherwise be lost to frauds. By helping prevent fraud, ThirdWatch helps everyone in that ecosystem, especially small e-commerce players who are sometimes forced to shut shop due to losses caused by fraud.
