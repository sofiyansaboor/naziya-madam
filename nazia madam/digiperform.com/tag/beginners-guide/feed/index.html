<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are a marketer or entrepreneur, you should know these basics if you want your business at top notch. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a content creator,  you may think or likely convinced that you know about your target audience inside and out. However, how often as a marketer you thought and do your data based audience research? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the answer is “</span><b><i>rarely</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “</span><b><i>no</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, that you need to deeply figure out how deeply you can work it out to club this as the “must to-do-task” into your to-do list to determine the cross-channel audience. This will not only nurture your knowledge while creating content, but it will also help you to make content marketing efforts successful. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Things To Keep In Mind While Identifying Your Audience</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Social Media, Audiences and Content Marketing &#8211; All are connected</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create </span><b>content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the help of content marketing tools, you share your content through </span><b>social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach out maximum active </span><b>audiences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These three (highlighted ones) are immensely connected with each other and quite dependent on each other as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you publish your content on blogs or create audios/videos, you need the distribution of the same content through multiple platforms to get deserved recognition. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where social media platforms play its role. Though building an audience online is possible only with a deep understanding of the online communities on each platform separately. As each social media platform as a different role to play in building the audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, these platforms work as a network as the source of a huge amount of granular audience differentiated on the basis of demographics, gender, interests, or education level, etc. Though this differentiation may sound weird in the beginning they can help to steer your content marketing strategy in the right direction. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>How does audience analysis can help you plan a successful content marketing strategy?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience analysis can play the role of a compass in an ever-changing but challenging content marketing world. As different content and social media trends, such as cinematography or stories, visual content come and go, however, the knowledge of your audience can help you to stay on track and feel connected with your followers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While studying social media analysis, it allows you to understand which piece of content is well appreciated by them. Also, it helps to experiment which format seem interested to your audience. You can use these insights to plan a long-term content strategy and organize your content-production teams more efficiently. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you are into e-commerce, then your audience would cherish <a href="https://digiperform.com/why-is-visual-content-important-for-your-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual content</a> in the form of pictures and videos rather than simple text blogs. What can you do with this piece of information? Well, you will be able to build an effective <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-chapter-2-how-content-marketing-relates-to-marketing-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing funnel</a>.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18840 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" alt="" width="375" height="375" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your audience allows you to create any form of content for each stage of your content marketing funnel strategy. We always suggest creating compelling visual content as it helps you to achieve the best results and your business objective which ultimately leads to end goal &#8211; </span><b>Conversion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as the </span><b>Happy Customer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h2><b>How to identify your audience for content marketing strategy?</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Conduct Market Research</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you really want to know your audience, all you need is to conduct a complete market research. Ideally, the market research helps to get as many details as possible about the group you’re targeting. This information you can also use later to build personas.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to do your research. Like you can make your action plan as per the <a href="https://digiperform.com/visual-content-marketing-statistics-marketers-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual content marketing statistics</a> available on the internet which gives you a binary idea about your market and the way the audience prefer to watch &amp; interact with. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of marketing tools can help you gather an abundance of data about your target audience. These digital marketing tools range in price but can provide assist you in building a foundation of information, ranging from basic demographic data to specific habits and interests.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you can do brainstorming with your teammates, reach out to other departments like a sales team. They have the practical insight that also helps you to understand the buying behavior of your audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, sit with digital marketing SEO department, they are very keen on marketing insights that will help to make strategies according to audience behavior. (SEO department will help to provide insight into the words customers use and what concerns are commonly brought up.)</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Research Social Networks</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Social networks are the best way to read your customer’s minds and behavior. This action plan is termed as </span><b>Social Listening</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which consists of monitoring the various social networks to discover that is being said about the brand, your competitors stand in the market and comparison along with topics relevant to your business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can even identify trends in your audience’s interests and problems. With the same study, you can identify their preferable platforms to communicate where you can listen to their social conversations as well as determine what type of content will be the most valuable and relevant to them.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Create Your Own Survey</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys can be very helpful when you want to gather more information about your audience as per the general demographics. Demographics, such as age, gender, income level, education, employment, etc. helps you to understand your audience at the next level and prepare your strategies accordingly.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.22.52-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18937 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.22.52-PM.png" alt="" width="520" height="422" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through surveys, you can survey a large population of interest, such as your existing customer base or potential market. The idea of surveying should process through online only. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience is more active on online platforms. With online surveys, the data is you obtain is quantified and gives you statistical results about your population. It reflects trends and commonalities (instead of individually) among your audience.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Build &amp; Identify Audience Personas You’re Targeting</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you collect various types of data from your audience, the next step for you to start building your audiences’ persona. Marketers, as well as content creators who use the study of these personas, achieve 73 percent higher conversions in their marketing strategy.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A persona is more than a buyer’s profile. A buyer persona is the representation of your prospect (ideal customer) based on market research and actual data about your existing customer base.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.24.36-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18938 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.24.36-PM.png" alt="" width="463" height="394" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a persona help to differentiate between the real and abstract audience. That will help you create right targeting content for them and engage in genuine conversations with your current and potential customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, It isn’t enough to just list down the personas and differentiate them into categories. Describe them in detail and describe each one.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can club basic demographic data along to categorize personas, but also other relevant information, such as the person:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interests</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain points</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priorities</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personality traits</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>The Takeaway</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your target audience plays a huge role in setting up and creating your content marketing efforts for a successful marketing campaign. Analyzing audience data, both across social media channels and with the help of other forms of collecting audience, should be the first step in creating an impactful content strategy that will help you achieve your business objectives.</span>

<h2><b>What is Influencer Marketing?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influencer Marketing</a> is a type of marketing that aims to grab attention by using influential people to amplify a brand’s message and project it to a given audience.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple words, instead of marketing the product or services directly to the audience, the brands would hire, pay or incentivize a person of social influence to review, name-drop or associate with the brand.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the small-scaled brands are using influential stand-up comedians to promote their products like the way <a href="https://digiperform.com/interview-session-souled-store-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Souled Store</a> collaborated with Stand-up comedian Kenny Sebastian and AIB to promote their funky t-shirts in the respective audience.</span>
<h2><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-12.07.22-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18546 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-12.07.22-PM.png" alt="" width="358" height="418" /></b></a></h2>

<h2><b>Why is Influencer Marketing Effective?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At a basic level, marketing is all about getting your message delivered to your audience or tied in with getting your plans to spread it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, broad communications (or advertising) was the favored strategy to accomplish these finishes. But now the ways have tuned into web directions.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best part of influencer marketing that helps brands to reach out to the local audience. An influencer can decide in what way they want to promote the product in their audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the audience looks for genuine reviews that can be related to them personally. Therefore influencer marketing comes very handy for brands if they want to target genuine customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When brands get influencer marketing right, they reap big returns. Consider these statistics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter users report a 2X increase in purchase intent when exposed to promotional content from influencers.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing content delivers 11X higher ROI than traditional forms of digital marketing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, businesses generate $6.50 for every $1 invested in influencer marketing.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Who are the Influencers?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When people think about influencers, they naturally imagine some top celebrity-type figures or TV actors. But influencers don’t necessarily have to be celebrities. They can be lifestyle followers, comedians, bloggers, industry experts, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They do, however, usually specialize in a particular niche and typically benefit from a large following on social media.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of social influencers come in the form of:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalists</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academics</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry Experts</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloggers/Vloggers</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides being influential to a lot of people, influencers are often different from the general public by the way in which they adopt new ideas and innovations.</span>
