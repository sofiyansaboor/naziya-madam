										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2a50a3;"><strong>#TraineeSpeak #DigiperformStory</strong></span></h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;Always aim high, work hard, and care deeply about what you believe in.&#8221; &#8211; Anonymous</strong></em></p>

This is well-catered by one of our trainees who haven&#8217;t even hesitated to <span style="font-weight: 400;">re-start her career and fulfill her dream &#8211; “T<em>he Dream to Be a Successful Woman Entrepreneur</em>”</span> after 18 years of her marriage.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2a50a3;"><strong>Meet Digiperformer Deepika Seksaria</strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2a50a3;"><strong>B.Sc Graduate, Lovely Housewife, and Mother of Two Handsome Kids &amp;</strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2a50a3;"><strong>Now, A Ful-Fledged Digital Marketer. </strong></span></h2>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24281 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/deepika.jpg" alt="deepika seksaria" width="356" height="356" />
She has always been fascinated by how the digital industry works, how Facebook Ads run, why Google always shows searches before you even complete the sentence, and etc.
We decided to get in touch with her and ask, Why after 18 years of marriage, she decided to make this move?
She said with a very sweet smile, &#8220;<em>I have two sons, elder one is studying in 12th standard and younger one in 10th. Now, my sons have grown up and started taking care of each other. Sometimes, I even feel they need me or not. Hahaha (laughs).</em>
<em>I discussed with my husband that most of the time I get idle and have nothing to do. </em>
<em>Shall I start following my passion for writing?</em>&#8221;
He was curious to know how I have come with this thought?
Later he said If I&#8217;m really interested, then I should go for a bigger level. He said I should go with the trend.
And, the trend is all about online marketing i.e. Digital Marketing.
And, Digital Marketing will answer all queries that I used to ask him every time while having dinner.
I researched for the best <a href="https://digiperform.com/advanced-digital-marketing-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing course in Delhi</a> and got to know about <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-in-delhi-pitampura/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digiperform Pitampura</a>.
The same moment I got enrolled in the weekday classes.
After my first session of website development, I created my first website, <strong>DeepikaSeksaria.com</strong>, all my own.
To be honest, It felt amazing. I still feel the goosebumps even when I think about it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
In <a href="https://www.deepikaseksaria.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deepikaseksaria.com</a>, I share various techniques to aware people of how to live life happily and peacefully.
Also, just after completing my digital marketing course, I got hired by 3 clients to handle their website&#8217;s blog and social media pages as a Freelancer.
All thanks to Digiperform. They really helped me in each session to learn everything about digital marketing.
Now, my passion and their perfect training helping me to grow and live my entrepreneurial dream.
<em><strong>How?</strong></em>
I am planning to open my own Digital Marketing Agency where I would be hiring digital marketing teams as well. I&#8217;ll definitely work hard to take it another level. After partnering with some clients, I have planned to start my own venture and obvious along with my loving husband.
<h4><strong>Digiperform:</strong></h4>
Wow, Deepika. You are amazing. It feels great and appreciated when our trainees work so hard to follow their passion. We are happy to help you and play the role of your mentor on your journey. We wish you great success and happy life. You will definitely grow as a Women Entrepreneur.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>#DigiperformStory #TraineeSpeak</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2a50a3;"><strong>Meet Jhulan Karmakar, our trainee from Digiperform Pitampura center. </strong></span></h2>
<strong>About Jhulan Karmakar:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s a housewife who is married for 18 years. She’s a mother of 2 handsome boys; studying in 12th and 5th standard respectively.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since childhood, she has been passionate about fitness and thoroughly follows Yoga &amp; Aerobics. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After 18 years of marriage, she felt that she should take her passion for Yoga to the next level. </span>
How?
We decided to get in touch with her and know her story. And, it was amazing!
Let&#8217;s read to find out.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Hi Jhulan? First, thanks for choosing us and be part of our Digiperform family. We come to know that you are a Yoga Enthusiast. We want to know more about you.</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>And, why you decided to learn digital marketing?</strong></span></h4>
<strong>Jhulan:</strong> Pleasure is all mine to be part of Digiperform. No wonder, you are the best.
I have been married for 18 years and have two kids who are currently studying. I am a fitness freak and love Yoga &amp; Aerobics.
My favorite pastime to do yoga with my kids.
One day my elder son asked me; &#8220;<em>why didn&#8217;t you work and share your expertise with the world. Its been like more than 20 years that you have been doing Yoga and you are fully qualified to be a Yoga Instructor.</em>&#8221;
Kids will be kids!
I told him I have been busy taking care of two souls. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
He sounded very serious and said that there are many ways to share your knowledge and earn in this digital era.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He suggested me to learn various online ways where I could share my fitness knowledge to the world through online platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I liked the idea, what he said, to be honest. I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">researched about the same. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, I found that digital marketing is the only way to promote my yoga skills with the world. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I started looking for various <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-delhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing courses in Delhi</a> on the internet and got enrolled in your weekday batches at <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-delhi/pitampura/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digiperform Pitampura</a> center as it was nearer to my place. </span>
After 18 years of my marriage, I realized that I stay free for a major part of the day and my boys have grown up. I should follow my passion.
So, why not?
Let&#8217;s do it and make some money.
Yay!
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24196 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/collage_yoga-1.png" alt="Yoga with Jhulan" width="583" height="417" />
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</strong></span></h4>
<strong>Jhulan:</strong> Of course! First, your study material is so wide and awesome. Secondly, your trainers are very supportive.
I was a little slow while learning during my initial days. They helped me a lot.
Now, I am a proud digital marketer, all because of you guys.
I would definitely recommend Digiperform as a trusted source to learn digital marketing.
Now, I have my own pages on social media platforms where I showcase my yoga skills. Also, I have started my own YouTube channel. It will grow eventually for sure.

<strong>Digiperform:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jhulan, we are proud of you. You are a true example stating “it’s never too  late to follow your dreams.” </span>
Your page will definitely grow and you will be known as the famous Yoga Instructor soon.
We wish you great luck.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/i-wanted-to-share-my-passion-for-yoga-with-the-world-jhulan-karmakar/">I wanted to share my passion for Yoga with the World. &#8211; Jhulan Karmakar</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>#TraineeSpeak</strong></h2>
In our trainee speak section, we decided to get in touch with one of the recently certified students of <strong>Digiperform Indiranagar Bangalore. </strong>
Meet Digiperformer <strong>Sri Ram Prasad</strong> who is currently working as a Brand Communication Executive at AMC Cookware, Bangalore.
Being a working professional, he was looking for various ways where he could help his company to increase sales and gain visibility in this digital era. He started looking for various platforms to increase the visibility of the company&#8217;s products.
Now, he is currently leading a team at his company where he manages all the digital roles of marketing and helping to promote at a large scale.
Digiperform Head Office decided to give him a phone call to know more about him and congratulate him for his success as well as asked about his digital journey.
By talking over the call, we realized that we can call him a smooth talker as he&#8217;s quite professional in talking and knows what he has been doing so far.
We asked him how his career journey got started, what motivated him to learn digital marketing, and how it has been going so far.
And, the conversation was splendid!
Here’s is the transcript of the conversation we had with him, summarized in a short way.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Hi Sri Ram, How are you? First, congratulations on getting digital marketing certified. You look amazing in the picture. We just want to know a little bit about your background. </strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>And, why you decided to learn digital marketing?</strong></span></h4>
<strong><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24127 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG-20190824-WA0012_2-1.jpg" alt="Sri Ram Prasad" width="429" height="572" /></strong>
<strong>Sri Ram:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, I’m Sri Ram Prasad K from Indiranagar, Bengaluru. I am a graduate and have been working as a Brand Communication Executive at AMC Cookware. Also, I&#8217;m a vivid landscape photographer and running my own blog.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During my tenure at AMC, I have realized that my company needs to be active on digital platforms to stay ahead in sales. Therefore, I decided to promote my companies products on social media platforms and sending mail to potential customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, I realized that promoting our products on social networks won’t be enough, they need to be promoted on Google where maximum research happens.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, I decided to learn how to run Google Ads on my own. During the time, my seniors asked me to take lead on this digital project and get trained by the experts. They suggested me to join Digiperform.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My motive for learning digital marketing was to enhance my skills and keep on adding the latest strategies to increase the sales of the company.</span>

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: You mentioned earlier that you have a passion for photography. Is learning digital marketing helping you in following your passion?</strong></span>
<strong>Sri Ram:</strong> Y<span style="font-weight: 400;">es, learning digital marketing not only helped me to increase my skills professionally, but it also helped me to live my passion. </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2a50a3;"><strong>#TraineeSpeak</strong></span></h2>
In our trainee speak section, we have got in touch with one of the recently certified students of <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-nirman-vihar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Digiperform Nirman Vihar</strong></a>, who is currently working as a Digital Marketing Freelancer.
Meet Digiperformer <strong>Sumit Pundir</strong> who is currently handling a freelance project of Dr.Bizz.
It&#8217;s a business consulting and a problem-solving company that helps organizations benefit from the wise usage of resources, integration of analytics and innovation for strategy creation, and decision making.
We decided to give him a phone call to know more about him and asked about his digital journey, how it got started, what motivated him to learn digital marketing, and how it has been going so far. And, the conversation was splendid.
Here&#8217;s is the transcript of the conversation we had with him, summarized in a short way.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Hi Sumit, How are you? First, congratulations on getting digital marketing certified. You look amazing in the picture. We just want to know a little bit about your background. We heard you have a blog too. Please share about it. </strong></span></h4>
<strong>Sumit</strong>: Hi, Thanks for the picture. I especially wore my convocation dress on the certification day to get the feel. hahaha.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During my graduation days, I had a passion for writing and got to know about online blogging. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, I decided to try my hand in blogging and started my own Bollywood &amp; Lifestyle <a href="http://mujhsepoocho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>MujhsePoocho.com</strong></em></a>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I was a movie geek, so, I used to write about the latest Bollywood movies and songs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even, one of my posts, “Top 10 Garwali songs for 2018-19” is ranking as number 1 blog in Google.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Wow, that sounds so good. So, how come you decided to learn digital marketing. Did someone shared to you about it or it was your idea only?</strong></span></h4>
<strong>Sumit</strong>: It was my idea only. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Once I completed my graduation, I decided to take my blogging passion to the next level and came to know about Digital Marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that by learning digital marketing, I could not only learn about how to earn through my blog, but I could also learn about running my own ads on Google. It felt amazing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, I opted for a digital marketing course, joined Digiperform and successfully completed my certification. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: That&#8217;s really good to know. So, what kind of projects you are handling now and for which company. </strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sumit</strong>: Yes, today, I am using all digital marketing strategies to grow my blog that I have learned during my training sessions and also have started taking freelance projects. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you can basically call me a Digital Marketing Freelancer. hahaha this sound so cool. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I handle a project of the company called Dr. Bizz and manage their social media pages as well as SEO ranking. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, I oversee all the digital marketing requirements of the company, from blogging to SEO, social media optimization to ORM, everything. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</strong></span></h4>
<strong>Sumit:</strong> Yes, definitely.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">I am thankful to Digiperform for guiding and mentoring me on how to advance my career in digital marketing. I am glad that I have chosen Digiperform. I would recommend the same to my other fellas too. </span>

<h4><strong>Video Transcript:</strong></h4>
<em>&#8220;Hi,  I&#8217;m Sejal, I&#8217;m from Haldwani, currently putting in Delhi. I joined Digiperform like 4 months ago and I got to know about the institute through an Instagram ad. And, that time I was looking for a digital marketing course; that sounded like a good decision to check it which was in the same city.</em>
<em>There is so much in the course and I was pretty impressed by the kind of curriculum they were introducing in just a span of 3 months. I got admitted into the course and along the 3 months, it has been a pretty career change thing for me. And, lots of things I learned; comprised Social Media Marketing, content creation, etc. I always had a knack for content creation, so it would kind of guiding light for me in that direction.</em>
<em>It helped me to custom to whole website designing and the fact that I could do lots of things which I was even not aware of.</em>
<em>It kind of made me realize the things I&#8217;m capable of and it made me feel great since then. The course ended well, I cleared all my exam along with the curriculum certification and Google.</em>
<em>I started interviews for an internship and I came to Horizon Holidays which I&#8217;m working currently on. It has been great her, I love work what I do now. I wake every morning with excitement that today I&#8217;m supposed to create the content and happy with the kind of profile they have offered me. It&#8217;s basically a travel agency that provides international tours. </em>
<em>Till now, it been a week only but it has been great. yeah! Basically, all putting into consensus, it&#8217;s just that Digiperform has been like a Kickstarter to my career and I would recommend if you are into any kind of creative field and you want to test out the waters; so, I would suggest going for something that would give you the thing. Which you all need because the skill set is very important. And, I guess, Digiperform will give you that.&#8221;</em>
