										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>#TraineeSpeak</strong></h2>
In our trainee speak section, we decided to get in touch with one of the recently certified students of <strong>Digiperform Indiranagar Bangalore. </strong>
Meet Digiperformer <strong>Sri Ram Prasad</strong> who is currently working as a Brand Communication Executive at AMC Cookware, Bangalore.
Being a working professional, he was looking for various ways where he could help his company to increase sales and gain visibility in this digital era. He started looking for various platforms to increase the visibility of the company&#8217;s products.
Now, he is currently leading a team at his company where he manages all the digital roles of marketing and helping to promote at a large scale.
Digiperform Head Office decided to give him a phone call to know more about him and congratulate him for his success as well as asked about his digital journey.
By talking over the call, we realized that we can call him a smooth talker as he&#8217;s quite professional in talking and knows what he has been doing so far.
We asked him how his career journey got started, what motivated him to learn digital marketing, and how it has been going so far.
And, the conversation was splendid!
Here’s is the transcript of the conversation we had with him, summarized in a short way.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Hi Sri Ram, How are you? First, congratulations on getting digital marketing certified. You look amazing in the picture. We just want to know a little bit about your background. </strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>And, why you decided to learn digital marketing?</strong></span></h4>
<strong><img class="wp-image-24127 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG-20190824-WA0012_2-1.jpg" alt="Sri Ram Prasad" width="429" height="572" /></strong>
<strong>Sri Ram:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, I’m Sri Ram Prasad K from Indiranagar, Bengaluru. I am a graduate and have been working as a Brand Communication Executive at AMC Cookware. Also, I&#8217;m a vivid landscape photographer and running my own blog.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During my tenure at AMC, I have realized that my company needs to be active on digital platforms to stay ahead in sales. Therefore, I decided to promote my companies products on social media platforms and sending mail to potential customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, I realized that promoting our products on social networks won’t be enough, they need to be promoted on Google where maximum research happens.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, I decided to learn how to run Google Ads on my own. During the time, my seniors asked me to take lead on this digital project and get trained by the experts. They suggested me to join Digiperform.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My motive for learning digital marketing was to enhance my skills and keep on adding the latest strategies to increase the sales of the company.</span>

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: You mentioned earlier that you have a passion for photography. Is learning digital marketing helping you in following your passion?</strong></span>
<strong>Sri Ram:</strong> Y<span style="font-weight: 400;">es, learning digital marketing not only helped me to increase my skills professionally, but it also helped me to live my passion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love landscape photography and always wanted to have my own website and pages showcasing my clicks.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, along with my job, I manage my own social media pages showcasing my talents and my love for photography. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It feels amazing that one skill can help you in so many ways, both professionally and personally. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sri Ram:</strong> Definitely! </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m glad that I decided to learn digital marketing from Digiperform. The faculty was so good. The trainers were so encouraging. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They helped me analyze my company&#8217;s current marketing strategies and guided me to understand how I could promote my company&#8217;s products in the best possible way. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They taught me so many ways, so many marketing strategies that could only an expert could guide you. </span>
How can&#8217;t I recommend such a nice learning resource for anybody?
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?</strong></span></h4>
<strong>Sri Ram:</strong> Haha, it feels like you are taking my interviews now, ROFL. I would definitely like to grow in the same company as <strong>Brand Head</strong> or may be working with a well-established brand.

To Be Honest, n<span style="font-weight: 400;">ow, I can proudly call myself &#8211; <strong>Certified Digital Marketer</strong>. I can easily create Google Ads and promote my company’s products on the basis of the ideal keyword research, all by myself.</span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform:</strong></h4>

We wish you good luck with your future endeavors.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/increasing-sales-with-digiperform-training-sri-ram/">I wanted to help my company by increasing their sales.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Digiperform always encourages trainees who have a zeal to stand out in the crowd and believe in living their passion.
Like, our trainee from <strong>Digiperform Malleshwarm Bengaluru</strong>, <strong>Smitha</strong>, who got recently appointed by one of the top digital marketing agencies, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sfidigital.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Feather Infotainment</a>.</span>
During the interaction, she shared that she always wanted to make it something in social media and now feel very delighted to be part of the industry.
So, we decided to ask what she liked the most about digital marketing and why she had chosen Digiperform to be her mentor in the digital journey.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: It’s a pleasure to connect with you! Before heading further, we would like to know a bit about you.</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Smitha</strong>: Hi, I’m Smitha from Bengaluru. Personally, I love listening to old songs and be more into traveling. Also, I like sharing my travel pics on my social media platforms. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to learn more about social media and pursue digital marketing certification from <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-in-malleshwaram-bengaluru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digiperform Malleshwaram</a>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After certification, I got appointed by Silver Feather Infotainment for the position of Social Media Specialist. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I officially know how I can promote myself as a brand. It’s the best part of this job. Yayy!</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: What originally attracted you to choose digital marketing as your career?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Smitha</strong>: As I was saying, I was looking for various ways where I could learn how to promote social media accounts. Even, I noticed that Facebook show your account as a &#8220;<em><strong>Sponsored</strong></em>&#8220;. This triggered me. Then, I made my mind to definitely learn about it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I researched it and realized, in digital marketing, you could learn all about social media. You can learn how to create your business account, create Facebook/Instagram ads, rank on top on Google page searches and grow your business simultaneously. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much to learn in this industry. It&#8217;s so creative and amazing. Anyone would love to be part of it. It has huge opportunities. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I made my mind to choose a <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-career-in-digital-marketing-will-shine-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career in digital marketing</a>. </span>
<strong>28 Full-Time Job Roles Available in Digital Marketing. And, I have chosen Social Media Marketing.</strong>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: What exactly that makes us stand out from the competition &amp; urge you to choose us over others?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Smitha</strong>: First thing I liked about Digiperform that they discussed my plans point to point. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They were not like creating puzzles. My counselors kept it simple and precise about the course, how it’s going to help me to reach my career goal and how Digiperform would play the role. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their practical approach made me feel very thankful that I joined this institute. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You guys are awesome!</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Tell us about your favorite experience you had with us, whether as a learner or as a customer?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Smitha</strong>: I loved interacting with our trainers and faculty heads. They are a super cool duo. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I liked our training sessions where we used to discuss the real marketing scenarios. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like at one instance, we were assigned of roles like Influencer, Entrepreneur and Digital Marketers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We did a role play where Entrepreneurs sat with digital marketers to design the next coming campaign for their XYZ company and how approaching influencers could help them to promote their products. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a mix of all the approaches that really helped us to understand the real scenarios of working in a company. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoyed it. </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Meet <strong>Ashwith Kulkarni, </strong>from Hubli (Karnataka) who got digital marketing certified from <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-in-malleshwaram-bengaluru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Digiperform Malleshwaram</strong></a>, Bengaluru.
Digiperform decided to get in touch with him and congratulate for his first digital marketing job. He is currently working with India&#8217;s leading digital marketing agency, <strong><a href="http://www.valueleaf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ValueLeaf</a></strong> as a Digital Marketing Executive.
During a chit chat, he shared why he decided to <em><strong>switch his career from</strong> <strong>engineering to marketing</strong></em> and how Digiperform helped him to give him a fresh start.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: It’s a pleasure to connect with you! Before heading further, we would like to know a bit about you.</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashwith</strong>: Hi All, I’m Ashwith from Hubli, Karnataka. I have completed Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you must be wondering if I have graduated in Engineering, then why Digital Marketing? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the irony! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even I never thought during my graduation that I would choose marketing as my career. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, here now I am, working as a Digital Marketing Executive in Valueleaf, Bengaluru. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: What originally attracted you to choose digital marketing as your career?</strong></span></h4>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The time is only for Marketing Professionals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, on a serious note, when I was looking for job offers, I realized everyone is looking for digital marketers who could handle brands’ online campaigns and help them to attract online customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I decided to get in touch with the experts and asked how it could help me if I go for digital marketing. The response was very positive. I was surprised too. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I am confident in saying that this is a booming industry. This is an ever-changing and engaging field; there’s always something new to learn. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am glad I have chosen a <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-career-in-digital-marketing-will-shine-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career in digital marketing</a>.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashwith</strong>: Personally, I liked the environment of the classes. The trainers were supportive and friendly in their teaching methods. You would feel confident around them. They made very easy for us to learn even the toughest of modules, just like that.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we used to complete our assignments in the class itself. My batch was brilliant and we had so much fun while learning. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashwith</strong>: As I shared, I miss our classroom training a lot. And, the time when we used to create own website and campaigns. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a learner, anyone would have missed it.  </span>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: If you were to review our training program, what score would you give it out of 10?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashwith</strong>: I would rate Digiperform perfect 9 out of 10. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashwith</strong>: Out of all parameters, I love social media marketing. So, I would love to see my self leading a social media company or becoming the head of the social media marketing team. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: If you had a piece of advice to someone just starting out, what would it be?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashwith</strong>: Learn digital marketing. Not only you can start your career, but you can also earn a lot through freelance opportunities while sitting at the home.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Finally, Describe Digiperform in one line.</strong></span></h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Meet Neha Sharma, a Digital Marketing Certified, a Proud Digiperformer.</strong> </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After 5 years of experience and working with big companies in metro cities, she was looking for an option where she could just lay and sit back with her family and work simultaneously. </span>
During the time, one word was just stuck in her mind i.e. <em>Freelancer</em>.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She was excited to be a freelancer and was looking for a <a href="https://digiperform.in/backup/digital-marketing-course-in-guwahati/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing course in Guwahati</a>, in her home town. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, guess what? She got it. She enrolled in our Guwahati center, got certified and now working as a freelancer with top-notch companies, that too from her sweet home.</span>
Yes, she is!
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a chit chat, we decided to meet her in person, ask what motivated her to learn digital marketing and join Digiperform. </span>
