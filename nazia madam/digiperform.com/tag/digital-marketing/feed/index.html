			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience of your product is essential, and not focusing on it enough will cause the product to fail. This is an issue that has affected many businesses, and it has caused them to shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will tell you about the five biggest UX mistakes that turn your users off. Knowing what these are will help you avoid making these mistakes and learn what you should not do when designing the UX of your product.</span></p>

<h3>5 Biggest UX Mistakes Turning Your Users Off</h3>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Using Responsive Design</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsive design is necessary, and you cannot avoid it. If your website doesn’t have a responsive design, then it will not be successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without responsive design, users will be irritated when using your product, and you need to make sure this doesn’t happen. People use various devices every day, and if your websites cannot be displayed on different devices and screen sizes, they will fail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a UX mistake that new <a href="https://www.tvisha.com/blog/difference-between-ui-and-uxwhich-comes-first">UX designers</a> can make, setting them up for failure. You need to know that responsive design is not a trend, and it needs to be a part of all of your designs. UX design consultant firms like </span><a href="https://clay.global/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will tell you how important this is and ask you to make it a fundamental part of UX design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already started designing your website and haven’t added responsive design, then you need to start again and add it in. If you don’t have experience doing this, hire UX design consultant firms and use their UX services to help you create the best designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never design your websites without making them responsive. You need to remember this and use it in all of your designs.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Using Carousels In Your Design</h4>
<p><a href="https://webflow.com/blog/carousel-slider-design-best-practices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have become a popular design trend, and designers are adding them to their website design without a good reason. This design trend doesn’t add value to the website that the user can benefit from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t need to be a carousel; you need to consider why you are adding something to the design and if it’s giving the user any value. Let’s focus on carousels in this article and use them as an example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the disadvantages of carousels in your website’s design.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They distract the user from the other content that is on the screen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user will need to navigate the carousel to find the information they want.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousels aren’t giving the user any value. The information can be presented in a different way that is less distracting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website’s design can look cluttered if the carousel isn’t in the right place.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would help if you looked at these issues when adding anything new to your website’s design. Don’t just add something because it might look good. Think about how it helps the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to use a carousel in the <a href="https://digiperform.com/importance-of-web-design-development-in-digital-marketing-strategy/">design</a>, you need to make it essential. Give users control, don’t make it automatic. Present information that users will want to know more about. This will cause them to click on the carousel and visit other pages of your website.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Thinking About The Mobile User Experience</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people use their mobiles to visit websites. This is why it’s essential to ensure your website’s <a href="https://digiperform.com/the-importance-of-user-experience-for-digital-marketing/">mobile user experience</a> is excellent. New designers can make this mistake, and it causes users to be frustrated and leave the website. When this happens, they will not return and instead use a different website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about what you should do when designing your website for mobile.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rearrange the content and elements on your website to make them easier to see on smaller screen sizes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make buttons larger, so users don’t have a hard time clicking them to navigate your website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove content that isn’t important. You have less space; you need to keep what the user is looking for and remove everything else.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify the navigation. Make it easier for people to navigate the website.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test your website on different screen sizes and improve to give users the best experience. If you need help designing for mobile, use the UX services that UX design agencies offer.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Discounting Usability</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design needs to be usable. You need to ensure that your design puts </span><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">usability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the visuals. If it doesn’t, this can cause people to have a bad experience when using your website and cause them to leave after a negative first impression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many products fail because they have poor usability. You need to make sure your website isn’t one of them. Understand who your users are and what they want from your product. This is what you should be focusing on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at similar products and identify how usable they are. Do they make it easier for users to achieve their goals? If they don’t, then why would people want to use them? Learn from this mistake and avoid it in your designs.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Simplifying</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/6-steps-to-write-a-perfect-website-design-brief-2/">Designers</a> need to simplify their designs. You need to keep what’s essential to the user and remove everything else. A cluttered design will cause users to leave the website, and you don’t want this happening to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out what users want and give them that. Everything else doesn’t need to be there. If it’s just taking up space and not giving users any value, why is it in your design?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing this requires understanding your users and what they want from your product. Research thoroughly before you start designing the UX of your website. This is how you can create great designs that people want to interact with.</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone once likened </span><a href="https://worldfinancialreview.com/5-digital-marketing-strategies-for-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generating B2B leads </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in today&#8217;s market to swimming without hands or feet. You battle hordes of competitors to get your voice heard only to encounter buyers who are shrewder than you thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet B2B leads are necessary if you want to increase sales. How you go about it is what we are going to tackle here.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>1. Account-Based Marketing (ABM)</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B buyers are increasingly demanding exceptional buying experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes beyond providing products/services and into personalizing their entire experiences—which is where ABM gets exciting. Through ABM, you identify your ideal customers, hone into those accounts, and engage with them on a personal level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-39554 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-1-300x228.png" alt="Account based marketing " width="530" height="403" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-1-300x228.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-1.png 447w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase effectiveness, companies employ an account-based salesforce strategy where specific accounts are entrusted to individual sales reps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales reps practically own the accounts assigned to them and handle their progression. They curate the most appropriate content to boost engagement, offer timely solutions, and carry the customer through the journey to conversion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top benefits of using ABM include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved optimization. Being a data-driven strategy, ABM allows you to comprehend needs and preferences. You personalize content based on your target account&#8217;s industry and stage in the purchase journey, then send it through their preferred communication channel.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better reporting. If your marketers stammer whenever you ask for a progress report, then ABM is for you. Since this is a focused strategy where detailed plans are drawn at the beginning, your team has fewer KPIs and metrics that can be tracked easily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitates higher engagement and retention. It&#8217;s easier and cheaper to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one. Through personalized content, you boost engagement and trust and forge stronger relationships with customers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offers higher ROI. Research shows that ABM yields higher ROI compared with other strategies. And thanks to the data and metrics in place, you can measure the revenue generated through this strategy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Cold Calling</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key question from buyers nowadays is, &#8220;Does this product/service make sense to my business?&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how frugal consumers have become, you&#8217;ll need to give them a reason to buy and </span><a href="https://saleshive.com/cold-calling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cold calling is the perfect strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39553 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-300x300.png" alt="what is cold calling?" width="519" height="519" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-300x300.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-150x150.png 150w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-75x75.png 75w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It affords you direct access to prospects, allowing you to sell the key benefits that will help reach their goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practices include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research your leads. Accessing information about challenges, needs, and preferences in just about every industry is easier now. Most companies also have digital footprints or publicly available information that you can factor into your pitch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalize your script. People will tell you &#8220;use a script,&#8221; we say, &#8220;no one wants to feel sold to, so use the information you researched to personalize the script.&#8221; Set aside high-value customers and personalize the conversation you would like to have with them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep small talk on the low. Greet your prospect, then quickly move on to introduce yourself and state the reason for the call. Asking the prospect if they can spare a couple of minutes to talk sounds polite, but you’re simply giving them the ticket to get out of the call. They can say no and hang up.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measure ROI. It&#8217;s easy to make 50 to 100 calls every day, but how many of those are converting into tangible results? Consider the monthly call-to-conversion rate, how many calls translate to meetings, and the number of deals closed from your cold calling efforts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Use Case Studies</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solid case study embodies businesses, problems, solutions as well as experiences that your target audiences find relatable. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It introduces the problem a consumer faced, their objectives for a solution, the processes they used to find the solution, and the results of implementing those solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39552 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-3-300x175.png" alt="how to use case studies?" width="585" height="341" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-3-300x175.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-3.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case studies validate the value behind your solutions in addressing consumer needs building credibility, generating interest among audiences, and encouraging engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how exactly can they help you?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are proof of success. A case study shows you know precisely what you&#8217;re talking about. It showcases successful solution implementation and the buyer&#8217;s satisfaction level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They outline your processes. Case studies go into detail about the specific processes you used to identify, suggest and implement solutions. They reveal your commitment to resolving your buyer’s problems from start to finish and the positive experiences you offer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They appeal to emotions. Effective case studies go beyond information sheets, ROI, and solutions. They weave a compelling story that appeals to potential buyers&#8217; emotions and influences them to engage you. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Email Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permission-based </span><a href="https://daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay?newsID=947006"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an excellent way of connecting with audiences, boosting awareness, and raising a tribe of loyal customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We say &#8220;permission-based&#8221; because buying email lists gives you access to people who haven&#8217;t voluntarily shared their personal information with you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your emails will probably be labeled spam which is no way of generating leads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39551 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-4-300x193.png" alt="what is Email marketing " width="600" height="385" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-4-300x193.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-4.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, it may take time to build a permission-based list, but it will be worth it since you&#8217;ll be speaking to willing and welcoming audiences. You can consider can outsourcing the process to professionals if your team is stretched or you don&#8217;t have the time to build the list yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how you can secure leads correctly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by identifying your ideal audience. A detailed buyer persona will help you understand the motivations, pain points, and buying preferences of the customers you&#8217;re targeting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create irresistible offers. Use what you’ve learned about your ideal customers to create resources that solve the problems they face. As they download these resources, they will exchange their info with you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work with social media. Run ads on social platforms, promote your offers, and create interesting posts around your offerings. With billions of active social media users browsing these platforms, you will gain followers and generate email leads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share valuable content. Signing up an email lead is just the beginning. You&#8217;ll need to create valuable content that piques their curiosity, engages, and nurtures them so they convert to customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. Leverage Landing Pages</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt-in pages provide a wealth of lead conversion opportunities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are dedicated distraction-free pages for capturing prospective customers&#8217; information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39550 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-5-300x231.png" alt="What landing page?" width="545" height="420" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-5-300x231.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-5.png 442w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practices include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversion starts with the design. Go for an easy-to-follow layout with theme-specific colors, well-spaced texts, and visible CTAs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write for conversion purposes, not SEO. With good reason, too. The person is already on your website and your present goal is to move them to action. Use compelling CTAs to trigger action, add testimonials for credibility, and highlight key benefits for the consumer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor performance. Metrics like the number of landing page views, average time on page, visitors-to-contact ratio, and bounce rate reveal the value of your landing page. You can then determine if you need to make adjustments to drive more conversions.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business world has changed drastically in the last few years, with the pandemic sending those in many different business sectors like marketing and advertising home to work. For many of them, it’s now hard to think of going back to how it was before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While remote working was </span><a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2021/11/remote-work-statistics.html#:~:text=32%25%20of%20All%20Employees%20Worldwide,by%20the%20end%20of%202021."><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before 2020, the pandemic has certainly sped this up, as a high percentage of office workers now work either fully remotely or in some hybrid form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though this has many benefits, such as creating a <a href="https://www.shinesty.com/blogs/news/work-from-home-survey">work/life balance</a> and cutting the cost of commuting, it’s natural that there are still some work expectations that haven’t changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially the case for those working in collaborative roles with a wide range of colleagues and teams on a regular basis. This definitely isn’t impossible to do remotely but it does need support from the right places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, having a team that understands the limits of remote working and this new flexible way of doing the job is key. However, team members aside, there are products that can support you when working from home too. Take a look at some of the best that we’ve gathered below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. A Good laptop</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laptops are so versatile now, with whole businesses being run from just a handful of powerful devices. When working from home was made the norm for many workers, laptops were the natural go-to device, as they could be taken home easily and packed up in seconds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have just your laptop, you can go from working in your home office to the kitchen to the sofa in minutes. Have to go into the office one day a week? All you need to do is pack your laptop and head out the door. It made perfect sense that these were the devices of choice for remote workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laptops can do so much more for those who work from home, though, than just provide flexibility. Many laptops are just as powerful as desktop computers, if not more so in many cases, and a good one can be all you need when working away from the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you work on a marketing team and are constantly passing designs back and forth? A laptop that doubles as a tablet may be perfect for this. Maybe you hold meetings with a high number of attendants? Devices with good cameras and crystal-clear screens like </span><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/d/14-inch-laptops"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenovo 14 inch laptops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be all you need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Somewhere you can share documents</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of collaborating with a team is sharing documents and working on them together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be part of the marketing department putting together a presentation for a new client or a member of a group of writers all contributing to a big piece. No matter what you need to share documents for, having a good platform to do so is very important, especially if you are working remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are </span><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3632983/top-file-sharing-services-dropbox-box-google-drive-onedrive-more.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">so many platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do this, some being free and others come at a cost. While there are certainly more well-known ones, it can be a good idea to shop around and see what is out there. You may find that, though one platform has a broad range of everything, another is better suited to your team’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sorts of platforms that allow you to share documents with each other and edit things or work together live were handy when everyone was in the office. They are even more crucial now, though, with team members rarely being in the same room all at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may even find that having this resource available to you allows you to work more smoothly together and get work done much more efficiently than ever before. Being able to collaborate in real-time is very valuable. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. A shared calendar</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote working went global as lockdowns meant no more meet-ups for a while. After this happened, there were many anecdotes of people moving all over now that they weren’t having to go into the office on a regular basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who lived in expensive cities bought houses in more rural areas to save money. Some working in other countries even moved back home, as they could stay at their current job without having to keep going into the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this was clearly the right decision for some, it meant that many of your colleagues were on different schedules and, in some cases, even different time zones. You can no longer look across the office to see if someone is working today or stop by their desk to see if they can make it to a meeting later on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where a good calendar app can really come in handy. Many of them allow you to share your schedule with colleagues and even have different calendars for various groups, teams, and departments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing when each team member has to time off, will be working on something else, or will be in another meeting is crucial for collaboration and can really aid with the shortfalls of remote working. With big projects due and deadlines looming, few things are worse than never having everyone in the meetings when you schedule them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to see when everyone is available, set a meeting for that time, and know that everyone will be there is such a great asset to have. You may also find that there is less back and forth between team members, as everyone is on the same page after one or two meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change to remote working for many office workers has been a blessing. It has allowed them to live elsewhere, balance their work better, and, in many cases, get more done. It cannot run smoothly, though, without the proper resources to help you out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many of these products, you can really bridge the gap between office work and working from home to the point where there is really no difference. With remote working here to stay, it’s time that workers adapted to it, with some help, of course.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing channels help you reach your target audience and establish a relationship with your customers while positioning your brand well to achieve your business goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determining which digital marketing channels to use should come from your unique objectives and target audience. However, it’s essential to understand which ones are most effective for businesses. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39443" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39443" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-7-300x196.jpg" alt="Digital marketing tools" width="531" height="346" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-7-300x196.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-7.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39443" class="wp-caption-text">Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Social Media</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 4.6 billion people globally using social media, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are crucial for growing your business. You can promote services and products organically and create popular content that is likely to be shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, sponsoring paid ads and content can help you complement your message and provide additional touchpoints for potential customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is an informal space which means you can use it to establish more authentic and personal connections with customers. It allows you to build rapport with your brand followers, giving a human touch to your company image and making it more relatable to the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to succeeding on social media is to create relevant content. To inform your decisions better, you should use social media analytics. In addition to the native tools, there are plenty of reliable third-party tools, such as the </span><a href="https://www.pathsocial.com/free-instagram-tools/instagram-profile-analyzer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram profile analyzer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which deliver accurate and reliable metrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging this data, you can curate successful SMM campaigns that resonate with your audience. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Email Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing is still a very effective digital channel for businesses. For every $1 spent, it generates $42. That’s an astonishing </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats?__hstc=76194634.41f2bed6730227cdc0f87e9dd4bfbe4c.1651044027325.1651044027325.1651044027325.1&amp;__hssc=76194634.1.1651044027326&amp;__hsfp=2060133651"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,200% ROI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which makes it one of the most effective options available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email is an excellent channel for promoting products and services, inspiring customer loyalty, and building relationships. It’s also a must for following up with customers, delivering targeted messages, and maintaining relationships to drive continued sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maximize your email marketing efforts, you should build an email list, create engaging content, target your audience, craft enticing subject lines, and strategize the best time to send an email blast. In addition, you can use the latest trends in digital marketing, such as automation and personalization, without breaking the bank. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>PPC</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay-per-click advertising is a specific advertising model where you pay only for the number of clicks your ad gets. This makes PPC attractive to small businesses with a limited marketing budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average cost per click is $1-2. However, it depends on the industry and your target keywords. For example, in competitive industries such as insurance, some keywords can cost up to $50 per click. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main benefit of paid search is that ads are shown above the organic search results, allowing you to capture an engaged searcher before they go to a competitor. PPC results gain </span><a href="https://www.highervisibility.com/blog/organic-vs-paid-search-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more conversions than organic results. It’s also one of the digital channels with great ROI — for every $1 invested, you get $2 in return.  </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Video Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 70% of consumers prefer to learn about a brand’s offers through video. This format is informative and entertaining, which is one of the main reasons why it has overtaken other content forms when it comes to user consumption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video can increase conversions, enhance ROI, and help you establish relationships with your audience. Moreover, you can promote your products and services through video, educate shoppers, encourage engagement, and even go viral. Well-placed video content combined with a robust video marketing strategy can boost the conversion rate by </span><a href="https://digitalagencynetwork.com/how-videos-can-increase-your-conversion-rate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From demo videos and educational videos to interview formats and testimonial videos, there are plenty of formats you can use to target audiences at any stage of the funnel. And, with the advances in technology, crafting high-quality videos is easier than ever.  </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>SEO</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every second, more than 63,000 searches are carried out on Google. And, the first-ranked Google results get an average click-through rate of </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-first-page-clicks/374516/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">28.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, standing in front of the competition means you’ll capture new opportunities organically, driving a consistent flow of leads. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_39444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39444" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39444" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-8-300x200.jpg" alt="Digital marketing channels" width="631" height="420" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-8.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39444" class="wp-caption-text">Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a website is likely your first thought when thinking about SEO, this strategy should also apply to all your business channels, including videos, Google My Business profile, social media posts, and your blog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adopting the best SEO practices such as keyword research, keyword optimization, and the creation of linkable content, you can ensure the website comes out on top of the search engine rankings. In addition, SEO is free, so it won’t hurt your marketing budget.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing channels have different outcomes, but the most successful businesses find a way to use different platforms in their marketing strategy to meet business goals. After all, your audience is likely diverse, so using a variety of channels can help you create multiple touchpoints, allowing you to nurture leads and boost conversions. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A funnel chart is a graphical tool that displays the percentage of a given population that falls into each category of a given data set. The data is typically displayed in descending order, with the largest category at the top and the smallest at the bottom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts are often used to visualize sales data, where the width of each bar corresponds to the size of the sale, and the height of the bar corresponds to the percentage of sales within that category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts can also be used to visualize other types of data, such as the number of website visits that result in a purchase, or the number of email subscribers that result in a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can even be used to show how data moves through a specific process in subsequent stages. A great </span><a href="https://www.tibco.com/reference-center/what-is-a-funnel-chart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funnel chart example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be anything from sales funnels to order fulfillment processes. Learn more about funnel charts on this page.</span></p>

<h4>How to Create a Funnel Chart</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39410 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-3-300x199.jpg" alt="funnel chart" width="609" height="404" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-3.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts are used to visualize the proportions of a whole over a series of steps. They are often used to visualize the conversion rates of a process, such as the number of leads that convert to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts can be created in Excel using the pie chart tool, and then converted to a stacked bar chart. This chart type is a simple and easy way to visualize a process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top of the funnel is the first stage while the bottom bar of the funnel is the final stage. The bars in between indicate the various stages in descending order, forming the shape of the funnel.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Benefits of Using a Funnel Chart</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A funnel chart can be used to visualize data that is collected from a survey or to track the progress of a project. The funnel shape shows the decrease of data as it moves down a subsequent stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main benefits of using a funnel chart is that it allows you to quickly and easily see how data decreases in a process. Additionally, funnel charts are easy to create and understand, making them a popular choice for data visualizations. They are perfect for highlighting the differences between proportions at different stages of a process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts also make it easy to identify any areas that require improvement within the data set. And they can be used in a wide variety of business and marketing contexts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chart type is a great way to communicate complex data in a concise and visually appealing way. They are an effective way to make data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Funnel Charts in Real-Life Application</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39411 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-4-300x200.jpg" alt="funnel chart " width="711" height="474" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-4.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say you&#8217;re the marketing director for a large company. You&#8217;ve been tasked with increasing the number of leads your company generates each month. To do this, you&#8217;ve decided to invest in a marketing automation tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You set up a lead capture form on your company&#8217;s website and begin collecting data on the number of leads your new tool generates each day. After a few weeks of </span><a href="https://www.behaimits.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you create a funnel chart to visualize the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the number of leads your tool generates each day is gradually increasing. This is a great trend, and you&#8217;re excited to see how it develops over time. The funnel chart allows you to track your progress and make necessary adjustments to your strategy as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you notice that the number of leads drops off around the middle of the funnel, you might need to adjust your marketing tool to be more effective and improve the </span><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/interactive/customer-experience-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being able to visualize customer dropout can help you improve your business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some components of what makes a funnel chart and how they can be used.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been said that space is the final frontier. But there are many who would argue that it’s cyberspace that offers even greater, perhaps infinite potential. And the vast number of websites already in existence gives weight to this thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been estimated that over 250,000 new websites are created every day. And with this in mind, it’s no wonder that it’s become a difficult task to drive traffic to any particular address on the web. But with the proper tools and techniques, you can get an edge on your competition and begin driving traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in business today, you probably understand that it’s greater brand awareness and exposure that gets you more traffic and higher revenue. But how do you go about doing this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a website is one thing. But driving traffic to your website is another. And if you want to shine a beacon from your little corner of cyberspace, the following will offer a few solutions to help you reach this goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Link Building</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want other visitors to find your site easier and organically, this means that you need to rank higher on a search engine results page (SERP). Higher search rankings are what all websites need in order to be considered relevant. And consumers look for relevancy just as much as they look for quality products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building backlinks otherwise referred to as inbound links, refers to the process of another website linking to yours. And when you’re able to link to sites with an established authority and healthy search engine rank, this builds credibility for your site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But link building isn’t a simple process. And this is why most business owners choose to partner with a </span><a href="https://stellarseo.com/services/link-building-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">link building service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that they know their links are being built properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few benefits of link building include the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased site credibility </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More lead generation </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain higher quality traffic </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain referral traffic </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build brand awareness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank higher in Google search</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more quality links you have and the greater quantity of authority links you earn will boost your web presence and prove to be an integral part of your overall marketing strategy. Because with more exposure via link building, you’ll soon see greater revenue. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Email Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many who claim that </span><a href="https://digiperform.com/7-writing-tools-to-build-a-successful-email-marketing-campaign/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a complete waste of time. However, if you’re looking for a marketing investment with the highest ROI and the ability to drive traffic, email marketing shouldn’t be overlooked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing requires research and tools that enable you to reach as many targeted customers as possible. With tools such as timed emails, form-fill tracking, and apps that make emails engaging and comprehensible, you’ll have an ideal toolkit for beginning an email marketing campaign. But how does email marketing help drive traffic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using the following methods, you can drive traffic through email marketing: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage subscriptions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer promotions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use responsive (mobile-friendly) emails </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize video</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporate infographics </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize your landing pages </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send personal emails </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cold-emailing may be a dead-end for some businesses, email marketing is still a key player for generating traffic and revenue. And the bottom line is that with more people added to your email list, the more potential visits to your website you’ll see. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Social Media</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to <a href="https://www.guestblogging.pro/how-to-increase-website-traffic-organically/">boost traffic</a> to your site, running promotions on </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/12/19/end-decade-heres-how-social-media-has-evolved-over-10-years/4227619002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great tactic to employ. And you can easily budget the number of social promotions you have each month without emptying your bank account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you run a business selling art or if you have an online craft store, you can promote individual posts on sites such as Facebook and Instagram. And these posts will contain links to your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During your promotion, you can analyze real-time data regarding how many impressions you’ve made as well as how many visitors your promotion brought to your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media marketing should also be incorporated with other strategies that gain you a larger following as well. And this is simply because your followers might be closely related to your target customer group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, taking the time to work on your social media marketing can dramatically increase traffic to your site if you take advantage of the many tools these platforms offer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving traffic is part of owning a website. After all, if you owned a physical store that received no traffic, you’d likely not be in business for long. And this is exactly how a website works. So if you build a big enough road, you’ll find that the traffic will increase over time. </span></i></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Is this going to be the year in which you quit the rat race? Or at least choose your own route for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People are job-hopping more than ever. Platforms like Fiverr make the gig economy stronger than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Plus, ever since we’ve all started working from home, we discovered that it’s actually quite cool to manage yourself, your time, and your projects—without someone physically looking over your shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unsurprisingly, a lot more people are finally discovering their entrepreneurial side, either by starting side-projects, or even by just taking the dive without any floaties like a permanent contract at a job they secretly hate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you also ready to take that plunge, but not sure yet in what direction to jump? You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, you could just take parts of your current job and start doing that independently—like many social media managers turned freelance copywriters do. But maybe you’re looking to do a complete 180, and want a job that fits the times we live in, matches with your passions, and doesn&#8217;t feel like a job at all, actually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’re not going to tell you how virtual assistants are in great demand and that dog sitting is fun. Instead, we’ve gathered 12 creative and fun ideas to inspire your entrepreneurial adventure. Ready to go?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Become a crypto coach</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you one of those people who somehow understand cryptocurrencies—and maybe even NFTs—and have you been successfully investing in all the right coins? That’s a great way to make an (extra) income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what if you could do more with all that knowledge? People are reading up about it, but at the end of the day, it’s a lot more comforting when someone actually tells you how and when to buy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s say, you know all about how to </span><a href="https://www.moonpay.com/buy/btc"><span style="font-weight: 400">buy BTC on Moonpay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, or any other type of bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could become a one-on-one coach about this, or even create an online course, to make this side-hustle all the more scalable.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>2. Start an at-home cooking service</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do your friends and family often come over to devour your food? Are you a master at meal prepping and making something amazing from the weirdest leftovers someone has in their fridge?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then you’re lucky, first of all. Many people struggle to come up with a pasta dish that isn&#8217;t the same as yesterday’s (and the ten days before) if they even have time to cook at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, you might not want to become a professional chef and spend most of your nights and weekends in a kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could consider starting a delivery service, but that would mean you’d spend more time driving around than cooking—and you want to do what you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">love</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So if you’re a talented cook, consider starting a local business where you go to other people&#8217;s houses to meal prep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can opt to do the groceries and create meals for the entire week in their kitchen—which also saves you your own kitchen and sanity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While this is a little of an upscale type of service, there are surely plenty of people around who are tired of the same old take-away every day and would love to try your fresh food!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Make yourself a hyper-specialized social media expert</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, social media marketing isn&#8217;t necessarily the most original job. But the big boys aren&#8217;t looking for generalists anymore, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their Instagram and LinkedIn are up and running, they just want to turn it into a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">success</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. So if you know how to use any platform like no one else, offer that as a service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, offer engagement services for Instagram. Or help people write great LinkedIn pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more specific it gets, the easier it’ll become to sell to people who already know what they’re doing—but acknowledge they need your help.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Become a remote work trainer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’ve been a digital nomad since before 2020, or you adapted incredibly easily, you’ve got a lot of valuable skills to teach others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people who are used to cubicles or trendy open-plan offices are still struggling with managing remote work. Which means their employers are also struggling with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can sell yourself to organizations as a remote work coach who will help them get the most out of their current employees, teaching them healthy ways to manage their work-life balance and boost their productivity. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Sell yourself as an ergonomic expert</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing on the previous point: a lot of people think they&#8217;ve got their home office routine completely under control. Meanwhile, they sound like a firecracker every time they get up for another cup of coffee. But no, they’re fine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’ve been working as a physiotherapist or in any other related field, and know a thing or two about working in a healthy position, market yourself to people who are working from home and don&#8217;t want to break their backs in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the right value proposition and laser-targeted market, plus maybe some referral deals and affiliate marketing with furniture stores, this could be a rather profitable business—and you’ll do a little good for others as well.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>6. Finally start that food truck!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this is not the time to recommend anyone to open a restaurant, we’re well aware. But if it&#8217;s always been a dream of yours, and you don&#8217;t like to be at the same place all the time anyway, why not open a food truck?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Admittedly, this is not a new concept, but it&#8217;s still a booming business, and perfectly fits the time we live in of outdoor events and being flexible. You could even use it to travel a little further and further because your market will simply be wherever you go.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>7. Travel planner for digital nomads</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oddly specific, right? That’s just how we like it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since remote work is becoming more accepted and standardized, people are dipping their toes into actual travel and work, instead of working from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if you think choosing a holiday destination is difficult, wait until you have to find a destination that has fast enough Wi-Fi to zoom your boss, has plenty of coworking spaces or at least coffee places that won&#8217;t kick you out when you type too loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of digital nomads have been there, done that, and if that’s you, consider helping people find their way in this world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could create guides on specific places and sell them, or make it all the more personal (and valuable!) by becoming a personal travel planner. You could even offer this service to companies who are encouraging their employees to use this time to explore the world while still getting the job done, for even more impact. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Become <i>that</i> specialized tour guide in your own city</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Live in a pretty place and know all about it? Now that tourism is starting to come back, you could use this coincidence to make a little money—while also getting out of the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there are plenty of standard businesses you could join to become a generic tour guide, pointing at the landmarks nobody was going to miss anyway. But with your specific, personal touch to it, you could make it into a little business too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, maybe you know all the best wine bars in your city, and you can create a tour around that. Or you were an enthusiastic dater in your early twenties and can show couples the most romantic spots in town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make it quirky, and make it specific. You could create tours especially for the elderly, or for families with kids. Market yourself in relevant places and start walking!</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Sell your photos as a stock photographer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have you always loved photography, and do you have countless pictures that are great—but not really useful for you? Sell them as stock photos! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this will probably <a href="https://www.printful.com/sell-art-online">start out as a small side gig</a>, but it&#8217;s nonetheless a lot of fun and gives you some reward for your creative work. You can upload your work on websites like Unsplash or Pexels and start earning money every time someone uses your photo. If things are looking up, you can even become more independent and start your own website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the amount of content that is being created every, well, minute, there&#8217;s a huge demand for stock footage, and anyone who frequently has to find that knows the most-used pictures by heart—so give them a fresh set of pictures!</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Dream big, but do bigger</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you can see, there’s a wide variety of options out there if you want to start a business. No matter how niche your passion is, you can turn it into a little more than that, even if it would just be to make a passive income from selling courses about your knitting obsession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re looking to double down on yourself and the opportunities out there nowadays, you’ll probably like this podcast on </span><a href="https://resources.audiense.com/blog/podcast-data-stories-leaders-at-work-gaelle-bertrand"><span style="font-weight: 400">developing yourself by seizing opportunities when they arrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, too. </span></p>

			<p>Keeping an eye on trends in the wider business community is always a good idea. Following sites like <a href="https://businesstrex.com/">businesstrex</a> will help you to keep your finger on the pulse when it comes to the latest developments and ideas.</p>
<p>Good communication is also a key business strategy. A good way of getting your message across is to use blogging as a way of engaging effectively with your core audience.</p>
<p>Here are four primary pointers about blogging that any business owner should be aware of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>It’s a great way to drive traffic to your website</h3>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons why blogging is so crucial to the success of your business is the fact that it gives you the perfect opportunity to convey great content to your target audience.</p>
<p>It is also a proven strategy for driving more traffic to your website.</p>
<p>It is a smart thing to do if you work on making your blog the heart of what you do on social media. Also, posting inbound <a href="https://www.milesburke.co/how-to-optimise-a-blog-post-for-seo/">links within your blogs</a> will provide you with the ability to drive traffic to targeted areas of your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Great for your SEO</h3>
<p>As a business owner, you will be acutely aware that delivering regular fresh content is great for your SEO.</p>
<p>Blogging presents you with a great way of using specific <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht">keywords</a> within your articles. This means that you can be super-savvy with your content by listing keywords and topics that you want your business to be aligned with.</p>
<p>Aside from these obvious benefits, regular blogging is a natural way of increasing your search keywords and boosting your marketing results in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Strengthen the bond between you and your customer</h3>
<p>Another key point about blogging is that it allows you the ability to develop and strengthen your relationships with new and existing customers.</p>
<p>Customers can learn more about what your business can offer them via the content you provide within your blog posts.</p>
<p>In addition, It can often be the case that you help to build that layer of trust that is key to a successful customer relationship when your blog is viewed as a reliable source of information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blogging helps with lead generation</h3>
<p>Many savvy business owners will happily testify that blogging is a fantastic way of converting visitors to your site into valuable leads.</p>
<p>A proven strategy for helping to make this happen is when you add a call to action within each post.</p>
<p>You can mix up the offering to see what works and to keep customers interested. For example, you can offer free product trials or maybe provide free and useful information that people will happily take in return for leaving their contact details.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that if you get your strategy right you can expect blog posts to deliver excellent returns for your effort. You need to take a long-term view of the strategy and build up your profile along the way.</p>
<p>Once you get the right level of attention, your business could really prosper from your blogging efforts.</p>
