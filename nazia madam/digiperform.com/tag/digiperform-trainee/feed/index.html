However, in this post, we would like to introduce you with 2 amazing and talented kids who believe to stay one step ahead from their fellow mates and passionate to get prepared for an awesome career while just studying in schools and colleges.
Let us introduce 2 very talented students, <strong>Mohit Goel</strong> and <strong>Bhavesh Kataria</strong>, who have enrolled in our <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-in-delhi-pitampura/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digiperform Pitampura</a> center and completed their <a href="https://digiperform.com/advanced-digital-marketing-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing course</a> while completing their basic education.

In his college, there is a provision that every student needs to be a part of a 2 months internship training program; whosoever wants to make a career in Business &amp; Marketing. The idea is to encourage students to enhance their skills and get ready to face outside competition.
But, Mohit has some other plans. He&#8217;s one step ahead of all his collegemates. He has always been fascinated by the digital world. Therefore, he made his mind not only to join the skill-enhancing program but <a href="https://digiperform.com/70-ways-to-make-money-online-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make money online</a> to cover his expenses simultaneously.

During the training, he has launched his own website, <a href="http://www.beingmohit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>BeingMohit.com</strong></a> where he would be sharing lots of happening stuff and the latest events of Business &amp; Marketing.
Now, after 3 months of his digital marketing training, he can proudly call himself a <em><strong>Modern Age Digital Marketer. </strong></em>And he is determined to take many freelancing projects as well as earn like a pro while pursuing his graduation.

<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/unnamed-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24353 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/unnamed-10.jpg" alt="Bhavesh kataria" width="388" height="393" /></a>
Bhavesh Kataria, an introvert but business-minded personality who&#8217;s currently pursuing 12th from open school.
He&#8217;s the only child of the family who lives with his mother. Since childhood, he has been looking for various ways where he can support his mother for a better living and start his career at an early age. He has been working with his cousin on various projects.
Later, his cousin suggested him to follow his passion for Fashion and learn how to share his knowledge with everyone. He asked him to learn Digital Marketing.
<a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-create-effective-digital-marketing-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24354 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/unnamed-12.jpg" alt="Bhavesh" width="339" height="343" /></a>
Bhavesh decided to take his cousin&#8217;s suggestion to join the best <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-delhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing training institute in Delhi</a> and enrolled in Digiperform Pitampura where he got fascinated to learn more about social media platforms and content writing.
During the digital marketing training, he started his own fashion blog, <strong>Fashion Feast World</strong>, where he had shared his immense knowledge about Men’s Fashion Clothing.
His trainer has so many good things to say about him, “<em>Bhavesh is a very creative and talented boy. At such a young age, he has the mind of a marketer with a pinch of a businessman. I’m sure that in the coming days, he’ll be going to do something big in his life.</em>”
Digiperform always encourages those who want to make big for themselves and have the zeal to accomplish something great in life.
We wish you good luck to both, Mohit and Bhavesh. Both of you will definitely be going to shine in your career.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/the-journey-of-2-trainees-from-students-to-digital-marketers/">The journey of 2 trainees from Students to Digital Marketers</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>#DigiperformStory #TraineeSpeak</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #2a50a3;"><strong>Meet Jhulan Karmakar, our trainee from Digiperform Pitampura center. </strong></span></h2>
<strong>About Jhulan Karmakar:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s a housewife who is married for 18 years. She’s a mother of 2 handsome boys; studying in 12th and 5th standard respectively.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since childhood, she has been passionate about fitness and thoroughly follows Yoga &amp; Aerobics. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After 18 years of marriage, she felt that she should take her passion for Yoga to the next level. </span>
How?
We decided to get in touch with her and know her story. And, it was amazing!
Let&#8217;s read to find out.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Hi Jhulan? First, thanks for choosing us and be part of our Digiperform family. We come to know that you are a Yoga Enthusiast. We want to know more about you.</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>And, why you decided to learn digital marketing?</strong></span></h4>
<strong>Jhulan:</strong> Pleasure is all mine to be part of Digiperform. No wonder, you are the best.
I have been married for 18 years and have two kids who are currently studying. I am a fitness freak and love Yoga &amp; Aerobics.
My favorite pastime to do yoga with my kids.
One day my elder son asked me; &#8220;<em>why didn&#8217;t you work and share your expertise with the world. Its been like more than 20 years that you have been doing Yoga and you are fully qualified to be a Yoga Instructor.</em>&#8221;
Kids will be kids!
I told him I have been busy taking care of two souls. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
He sounded very serious and said that there are many ways to share your knowledge and earn in this digital era.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He suggested me to learn various online ways where I could share my fitness knowledge to the world through online platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I liked the idea, what he said, to be honest. I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">researched about the same. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, I found that digital marketing is the only way to promote my yoga skills with the world. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I started looking for various <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-delhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing courses in Delhi</a> on the internet and got enrolled in your weekday batches at <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-delhi/pitampura/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digiperform Pitampura</a> center as it was nearer to my place. </span>
After 18 years of my marriage, I realized that I stay free for a major part of the day and my boys have grown up. I should follow my passion.
So, why not?
Let&#8217;s do it and make some money.
Yay!
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24196 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/collage_yoga-1.png" alt="Yoga with Jhulan" width="583" height="417" />
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</strong></span></h4>
<strong>Jhulan:</strong> Of course! First, your study material is so wide and awesome. Secondly, your trainers are very supportive.
I was a little slow while learning during my initial days. They helped me a lot.
Now, I am a proud digital marketer, all because of you guys.
I would definitely recommend Digiperform as a trusted source to learn digital marketing.
Now, I have my own pages on social media platforms where I showcase my yoga skills. Also, I have started my own YouTube channel. It will grow eventually for sure.

<strong>Digiperform:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jhulan, we are proud of you. You are a true example stating “it’s never too  late to follow your dreams.” </span>
Your page will definitely grow and you will be known as the famous Yoga Instructor soon.
We wish you great luck.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/i-wanted-to-share-my-passion-for-yoga-with-the-world-jhulan-karmakar/">I wanted to share my passion for Yoga with the World. &#8211; Jhulan Karmakar</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

Here&#8217;s is the transcript of the conversation we had with him, summarized in a short way.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During my graduation days, I had a passion for writing and got to know about online blogging. </span>

Now, she is working as a <strong>Digital Marketing Consultant</strong> at <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.chromozomenetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chromozome Network</strong></a>. </span>
Like always, we decided to get in touch with her to congratulate on her success. She thanked Digiperform for helping her to restart her career.
Here is the transcript of the discussion we had with Ashita.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: It’s a pleasure to connect with you! Before heading further, we would like to know a bit about you.</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashita:</strong> Hola! I’m Ashita Banerjee from Bengaluru. I had an experience of 2 years in Supply Chain Management. But left the same profile due to personal reasons. After some time, I decided to restart my career and give another chance to myself.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, I decided to learn digital marketing. I joined <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-in-indiranagar-bengaluru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Digiperform Indiranagar</strong></a> and cleared the digital marketing examination with distinction. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I’m a proud digital marketer and working as a Digital Marketing Consultant at Chromozome Network, Bengaluru. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: What originally attracted you to choose digital marketing as your career?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashita:</strong> After leaving my last job, I was looking for the industry where the background of your education and professional experience wouldn&#8217;t be the deciding factor to start your career. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the research, one of my friends, who is also a digital marketer in Bengaluru told me about the career prospects of digital marketing. And, I was really surprised by the fact that how could the industry be so open-minded. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This touched my heart. Also, I analyzed that this is the booming industry of this century for every field of people, whether you are a job seeker or an entrepreneur. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am very thankful that my friend told me about this. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: What exactly that makes us stand out from the competition &amp; urge you to choose us over others?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashita:</strong> One thing I really liked about Digiperform that they are very serious when it comes to trainees’ career. The intention of this digital marketing institute is really very ethical and institute definitely don’t consider teaching students as a business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They have experienced faculties. This really makes Digiperform stand out from the competition. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Tell us about your favorite experience you had with us, whether as a learner or as a customer?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ashita:</strong> I won’t like to brag about it. But, to be honest, I had a great time when we used to have practical sessions of the modules during the classes. It felt like we were living the moment and working for real companies. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder, our trainers became were damm serious with the results of practical training too. (ROFL)</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Meet <strong>Ramparas</strong> who got <strong>Digital Marketing Certified</strong> from <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-course-in-malleshwaram-bengaluru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digiperform Malleshwaram Bengaluru</a> center. He is one of the brilliant trainees we have, who got placed just after the completion of a digital marketing course.
Therefore, we decided to get in touch with him personally and congratulate him for his first digital marketing career success.
He is currently working as a <strong>Social Media Specialist</strong> in one of the leading digital marketing agencies of Bengaluru, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sfidigital.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silver Feather Infotainment</a>.</span>
During the call, we decided to ask him a few questions regarding why he decided to learn digital marketing and how it feels to be part of Digiperform. The answers we received were splendid.
Here is the transcript of the overall discussion we had with him.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: It’s a pleasure to connect with you! Before heading further, we would like to know a bit about you.</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> Hi I’m Ramparas, I belong to Bengaluru and completed my digital marketing certification from Digiperform Malleshwaram.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always been curious about social media memes and platforms. I used to spend my whole day watching memes and social media stories. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While scrolling down memes and images on Facebook, I saw one image saying that “<em>If you love Facebook so much, then why don’t start working on Facebook</em>.”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This literally shocked me that how could I work on Facebook. Was it actually possible?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I started my investigation as Sherlock Holmes and decided to know more about Digital Marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I’m working as a Social Media Specialist in Silver Feather Infotainment. My detective skills paid off and, I’m loving it!</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: What originally attracted you to choose digital marketing as your career?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> As I said earlier, why I loved social media marketing and how I decided to learn digital marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, while my research, I figured out that Digital Marketing has multiple roles where you could choose any role of your choice. And, these roles have their own charm. Yeah! It&#8217;s interesting to work as a digital marketer.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in my opinion, the people have one sort of mentality regarding Marketing that “<em>Marketing means door-to-door marketing i.e. field work.</em>” </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddy, if you are thinking like that, then you are completely wrong. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is completely not a field job. It&#8217;s an amazing industry. A creative industry. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With digital marketing, you can work from any part of the country, anywhere. All you need is an internet connection and a laptop. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, in case if you started working as a Freelancer, then you can work as per your own convenience. No pressure for Your Boss! You gotta be your own Boss. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors make me fall for digital marketing and decided to choose a <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-career-in-digital-marketing-will-shine-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career in digital marketing</a>. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: What exactly that makes us stand out from the competition &amp; urge you to choose us over others?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> There are many things like</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LMS &#8211; this is an awesome feature that helped me revise my classes at night. It helped to clear my doubts as well as regain more confidence. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your infrastructure is amazing that makes classroom learning interesting. Yeah for me, If I don&#8217;t like the place and infrastructure, I can&#8217;t learn or work there.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trainers are very supportive. Even after clearing my certification, I can ask about any query related to my profession. They are very happy-go-lucky people.</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Tell us about your favorite experience you had with us, whether as a learner or as a customer?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> I really had a great experience at Digiperform. It felt like I was back to my old school days where we used to sit together and perform our practicals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt so amazing!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe one should always go for classroom training instead of online. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These little moments could make your learning process very interesting. </span>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> Yes, they deliver what they promise. Like, whenever I wanted to have a doubt session, they provided me. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, they helped to have my first digital marketing job just like that. They give you 100% placement support. What else you need, man? But for the same, you need to work hard as well. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: If you were to review our training program, what score would you give it out of 10?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> I would give a perfect 10 out of 10. I’m a happy Digiperformer!</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?</strong></span></h4>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: If you had a piece of advice to someone just starting out, what would it be?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> Don’t delay or waste your time. If you want to learn digital marketing, then don’t think twice. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Go for it. Be a Digipeformer.!</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform: Finally, Describe Digiperform in one line.</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ramparas:</strong> In my eyes, its Number 1 Digital Marketing Institute in all over the country. </span>

<strong>Digiperform:</strong>
