<b>Now let us show how to write a perfect cover letter every time. Here is a step by step guide to writing a perfect internship letter for your digital marketing Internship.</b>
<h2><b>Step 1: Addressing a Cover Letter:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to miss a golden opportunity to land the interview just because you don’t know how to address a cover letter?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely not.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorrect addressing of a letter sets the wrong tone. And create a bad impact on the hiring manager.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some Do’s and Don’ts to keep in mind while addressing a cover letter</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Do’s</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s always safe to start your salutation with the word “</span><b>Dear</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in a business letter. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know 40% of managers prefer &#8220;</span><b>Dear</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” over any other form of salutations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a proper salutation sets the tone for your letter and proves the receiver that you know basic rules of business etiquette.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just simply use: </span><b><i>Dear Anita</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your hiring manager has a title such as Professor, Dr., or Captain, then use that title in place of their first name. It gives them a positive feeling.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: </span><b><i>Dear Dr. Batra,</i></b>
<b><i>Dear Professor Malhotra</i></b>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Don’ts</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never address a cover letter with salutations like &#8220;</span><b>Hello</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; or &#8220;</span><b>Hi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;. It seems too informal. It shows the recruiter that you don’t know the basic business etiquettes.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t use &#8220;Dear Sir or Madam&#8221; if you don&#8217;t know the name of recruiter until you are from the 18</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century.</span>
<h2><b>Step 2: First Paragraph</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know a hiring manager receives hundreds of application in a day.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your cover letter should hook him right away to stand out on those hundreds of letters and applications.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And your first paragraph plays a major role in this.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are two examples showing two different types of cover letter for an internship.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>Incorrect Way</b></span></h2>
<b><i>“ I would love to get this digital marketing internship opportunity. If you hire me, I&#8217;ll work extremely hard and bring all my considerable passion to bear as your dedicated employee. I&#8217;ve completed rigorous coursework at UMass Boston to earn my BA in design. In addition…”</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing wrong with this cover letter sample, but the letter is specifically written for the manager only.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there is nothing new and innovative in it. Everyone applying for this internship role will promise to work hard. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Correct Way </b></span></h2>
<b><i>“ I was so excited that my profile is shortlisted for Digital Marketing Intern Role.</i></b>
<b><i>It was no accident. Social media and internet have been a great passion of mine since a very long time. I consider the internet as the best source of knowledge and information. “</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can clearly see the difference … </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first portion of the paragraph is innovative and will appeal to the manager more. And the second tells a convincing story of why you’re best for this position.</span>
<h2><b>Step 3: Paragraph 2</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A company will hire you if they see something unique in you. You should prove to them that this organization is best for you and how your skill sets can contribute to the organization’s growth.</span>
<b>Now let’s look at the examples:</b>
<h3></h3>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Incorrect way:</strong></span></h2>
<b><i>“ I did very well in training program. I earned Google &amp; Facebook certifications. I know about time management, collaboration, and problem-solving. I also…&#8221;</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
Let us say this in common words: It says, &#8220;I&#8217;m great&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what&#8217;s in it for the organization?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now check out the next one:</span>
<h3></h3>
<h2><strong>Correct Way</strong></h2>
<em><strong>“ XYZ Inc.&#8217;s dedication to nurturing its interns far beyond the workplace strikes directly to my appetite for continuous growth. I look forward to growing my digital marketing skill sets to advance your quality, cost, and leads. “</strong></em>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">See how the second one is more relevant and impressive than the first one. You are showing that how your digital marketing skills are relevant and beneficial for the organization. </span>
<h2><b>Step 4: Paragraph 3</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your first paragraph explains why you are perfect the job. The second one shows why the organization is ideal for you.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it should ask for something.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes&#8230; the Call to Action (CTA).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that It&#8217;s very easy to say, &#8220;</span><b><i>Can you schedule an interview?</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However It&#8217;s more effective if you write, &#8220;</span><b><i>Can we discuss how I can help?</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
Here is an example showing despite having a good start how an internship falls flat?
<h2><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Incorrect Way</span></strong></h2>
<em><strong>“ I would love to talk more with you. “</strong></em>
Boring old same Call to action line… here is the different one for you.
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Correct Way</strong></span></h2>
<em><strong>“ I would love to put my skills and passion together to work for you. Can we schedule a call to discuss more regarding the job role? “</strong></em>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Bonus:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, cover letters are filled with&#8230;&#8221;Words words words&#8230;&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s more like a robot reading the book.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To catch the optic nerve of a recruiter?</span>
<strong>Use bullet points.</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They are best in highlighting your accomplishments. Show them how passionate you’re for digital marketing. How extra moves and efforts you’ve taken to get into this field.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And always put them in the 2nd  paragraph.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Example: </span>
<em><b> “ My enthusiasm to learn more about the industry urged me to join the advanced level training in Digital marketing. My classes lit the way, but I dug deeper with:</b></em>
<ul>
 	<li><em><b>Reading EBooks and guides on Digital marketing</b></em></li>
 	<li><em><b>Listening podcasts of top digital marketers</b></em></li>
 	<li><em><b>Freelancing work on nights to get maximum exposure “</b></em></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the basics of writing a great cover letter for an internship makes all the difference.
