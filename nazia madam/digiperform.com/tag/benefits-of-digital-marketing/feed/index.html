										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing in the modern age is becoming digital. To such a point, that most startups and small businesses are eschewing traditional media entirely. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While larger-scale businesses continue to utilize traditional media methods, across the board, digital media has become the primary communication and promotion method for brands. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How this move from traditional to digital marketing has taken place? And what does it mean for marketers?</span>
<h2><strong>Traditional Marketing Basics</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conventional or traditional marketing methods are the grassroots of marketing. They have developed decades ago and many of them continue to be used even today. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the more popular kinds of traditional media include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newspapers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magazines</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flyers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brochures</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct Mail</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold Calling</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billboards</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Television</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As one can see, traditional media encompasses a wide variety of forms from newspapers, that have existed for a couple of centuries, to television, which was considered the most modern method of marketing only a few years ago.</span>
<h2><strong>Digital Marketing Basics</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-guide-marketing-todays-digital-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital marketing</a> exclusively exists within the realms of the internet. It includes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Websites</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engines</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emails</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online brochures</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online PR</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital sphere is vast and is constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of consumers. It is highly likely that the face of digital marketing will have changed significantly in just a few years.</span>
<h1></h1>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Traditional Marketing</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand how traditional and digital marketing differ from each other, we need to look at the benefits and disadvantages of each.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the advantages of traditional marketing is that it is a long-standing and stable method of marketing. It’s been tried and tested, unlike digital marketing, that is still changing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For established businesses who are still learning the ropes of the digital world, traditional marketing is a convenient fallback that still produces results.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another benefit is the local appeal that traditional marketing provides. Flyers and brochures can be distributed in select areas—and often as a supplement with newspapers. Billboards have visual appeal in a localized area and are great for brand recall.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While digital ads are gaining prominence, consumers are already used to traditional ads in newspapers, magazines, and on television. Consumers react more positively to ads located in familiar areas, which increases the effectiveness of traditional marketing.</span>
<h2><strong>Disadvantages of Traditional Marketing</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the move to digital has negatively impacted much of the print media.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Newspapers were the earliest forms of traditional media but have slowly been fading out over the last decade. A number of newspapers around the world—particularly local papers—have closed down. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prominent newspapers are now moving to a digital-only option, many of them installing a paywall to continue their work.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional advertising also skews towards the higher end of marketing budgets. Billboards can require upwards of thousands of dollars to be displayed for a short period of time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also additional costs associated with print marketing—the cost of printing, ink, installation, and distribution. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For small businesses, traditional marketing is often not feasible at the initial stages of business promotion.</span>
<h1></h1>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Digital Marketing</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of digital marketing is no surprise, especially because of the low cost involved. There are numerous ways to organically reach one’s audience—like utilizing SEO practices—which is not possible with traditional marketing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even paid advertising, such as sponsored social media posts and pay-per-click ads, don’t make as much of a dent in a brand’s budget as traditional advertising.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, digital marketing gives businesses access to statistics and insights that traditional marketing has yet to achieve. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through social media and Google analytics, as well as email marketing statistics, marketers can pinpoint their audience’s interests to the minutest detail. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This not only helps marketers reach the right audience with the right content but also to tailor their content to their market’s needs.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And personalization has become one of the most important aspects of digital marketing. There is so much information available online—particularly through social media and newsletter signups—that marketers can now create personal connections with their audience that was not possible earlier.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the live element of digital marketing has made marketers’ lives far more convenient. They have access to statistics in real-time so they can adapt and change their content to their audience’s needs even before a campaign has been completed.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing also has no limits in terms of geographical reach—anybody anywhere can access your site and your content, which means even the smallest businesses can have a wide reach. </span>
<h1><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/benefits-of-digital-marketing.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-23721 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/benefits-of-digital-marketing.jpeg" alt="benefits of digital marketing" width="602" height="452" /></a></h1>
<h2><strong>Disadvantages of Digital Marketing </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the numerous benefits of digital marketing, there are a handful of drawbacks that marketers have to be aware of.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief among them is that digital marketing is constantly changing, which makes planning marketing strategies in advance quite difficult. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, many C-Level executives who have been in business for a long time tend to distrust digital marketing, choosing to rely on traditional marketing instead. For marketers working in these companies, convincing upper management to move to digital can be an arduous task.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers are also becoming much more wary of digital marketing—especially considering the issues with Facebook and Twitter in recent years. Convincing doubtful consumers to engage with digital marketing activities requires marketers to be more creative than ever before.</span>
<h1></h1>
<h2><strong>Digital and Traditional Marketing Work Together </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though critics are pitting traditional marketing against digital marketing, the ideal strategy is to combine both, if budgets allow.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing has definitely seen great strides in recent years, but traditional marketing still has a place in consumers’ lives. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While startups and small businesses are well within their right to focus their efforts on digital marketing, large businesses have the option to use both. Small businesses can incorporate traditional media methods once they bring in profits.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both forms of marketing have their advantages and disadvantages, and if utilized correctly, they can promote a brand far and wide.</span>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days social media is not only for creating social profiles, posting, tweeting, sharing videos &amp; memes; it plays a role in business and marketing as well. More than <em>25% of the total time spent online on social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, etc. and 60% of buying online occurs based on the reviews</em> that are seen on social media. If we talk about Facebook alone which is one of the highly used social media platforms, has more than <em>2.6 billion monthly active users</em>. This is why any businesses should consider advertising through Facebook post and other social media marketing sites to explode their businesses. It’s a great opportunity for a company to make online sales, get a following around the brand, create a platform where customers can discuss the products and services, when done successfully, let people spread the word about the brand’s qualities.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14111" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fb2-300x169.png" alt="Facebook Monthly Users" width="696" height="392" />
<b><i>More facts about Facebook:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-1.55 billion people on average log onto Facebook daily and are considered daily active users for September 2017, which represents a 16 percent increase year over year.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Facebook users are 76% female (out of 100% of all females) and 66% male (out of 100% of all males).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-Highest traffic occurs mid-week between 1 to 3 pm.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">-42% of marketers report that Facebook is critical or important to their business.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These facts give an idea about how Facebook can bring wonders in the business promotions. Creating the Facebook business page and boosting it will help to increase brand awareness, brand engagement, promoting new content and blogs. The Companies are spending money to boost their business’ pages with a specific goal in place to bring out the right visibility and brand awareness through social media mediums. For those who still are not having an idea, what we are discussing here, let’s have an overview then:</span>
<b>What is Boosting a Post or Page?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Facebook and various other social media platforms, you find a Boost Button which allows you to create a Facebook ad quickly using your post or page. This ad appears in different places on Facebook as a Sponsored Ad. Boosting a post from your business Page is a quick and easy way to show your content to people who might be interested.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A boosted post is a post from your business Page (chargeable), can appear higher up on your audience’s News Feeds. The fee depends on how many people you want the post to reach, the number of days you want to select, and the payment depends on the number of impressions the post gets with time.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14112" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fb3-300x174.png" alt="number of impressions" width="671" height="389" />
<b>Which Facebook Page should Boost?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since your page may have many posts and contents, choose the post which can deliver or have potential to deliver high ROI. In short, choose the content with the highest ROI value. Also, you can boost the informative content that can create brand awareness for a longer run. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a rule of thumb, a post worth boosting also satisfies the following criteria:</span>
<ul>

<b><i>Find the best time to boost a post</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time plays the key role in your marketing strategy. When to boost or when not to. It is the major factor to keep in mind when boosting a post. For companies that have been actively running a Facebook account are well aware or know how the boosted post runs, what days and times their audience is online should be common knowledge. For companies that have yet to determine Post Boosting, it helps to test out posting at various times of the week to get a feel for when their users are most active, and when they are not.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once companies have figured out the best time to boost a post, they should focus boosting activity at these times to increase its effectiveness. You can adjust the timings for your ads through Facebook Ad manager. </span>

<b><i>Maximize Targeting Options</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to boost a post but it’s hard to boost it effectively. The key lies in whom you are targeting and how. Based on the goal, companies have the ability to target anyone they want on Facebook. When boosting a post, Facebook offers the following targeting options:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest</span></li>
</ul>

<b><i>Include specifications for your Target Market:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to decide what’s the goal for your every post when you set up them to boost. You may want to reach users that are engaged and looking for a wedding photographer, or maybe you want to reach who are looking for travel packages. As stated earlier, Facebook allows you to use specifications such as age, gender, location, language, and relationship status to reach your target clients. For example, if most of your audiences come from a certain location or area, refine your boost to that location.</span>
<b><i><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14057" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dashboard-google-analytics-social-media-web-performance-300x202.png" alt="Target Market" width="661" height="445" /></i></b>
<b><i>Share Compelling Content:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided the specifics of your target market, you can then decide what type of content you would like to share with them which can add benefit and should be result oriented. The benefit of limiting the recipients of the boosted post is that you will be able to share content that is specific to that group of people. If you have content that you want to share but it may not be the best for a custom audience you have already set up, consider creating a new custom audience to see if it gains more interaction.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>“You have to dream before your dreams can come true.”</em></strong> &#8211; Abdul Kalam</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The quote especially defines the fresher’s state of mind. They are generally like a small bush who needs to nurture their career as per the marketing demands and trends. One wrong decision can make or ruin their career. However, today’s generation is very smart and knows what is the ideal path-breaking progression for them to nurture their career. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All thanks to the digitalization that students of the current generation are more aware and creative enough to accomplish anything. They know everything related to the internet, whether you talk about shopping, banking, watching commercials, news and getting involved in socialization. Therefore, the internet has become the necessity to live and earn as well. It has immediately become apparent to invest your career on digitalization rather than trying out old methods.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13961" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cem_sari_blog_gorsel-300x132.png" alt="Digitalization" width="630" height="277" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the benefits of digital marketing, the businesses are also more into investing in the digital marketing rather than carrying out the old traditional ways. They are investing in digital marketing like never before which has resulted in bigger budgets, more career opportunities, increased payout and much more. There are many reasons why students should prefer to learn digital marketing and add this demanding skill to their resumes. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have listed why it’s a good call to consider to <a href="https://digiperform.com/should-learn-digital-marketing/">learn digital marketing</a>. How can digital marketing certification bring out the ideal Digital Marketer for you? What are the best reasons to get the digital marketing certification? You will get all your answers in this one post. Before that one should know what digital marketing is all about?</span>
<h2><strong>What is Digital Marketing?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing is the combination of online practices and strategies that help to promote and advertise the products or services through the internet medium. It’s a set of tools and marketing practices that help to build brand reputation and create awareness. In order to gain more online traffic and customer base, digital marketing is one come short and reliable way to stand first in the online market. </span>
<h2><strong>Why should one be Digital Marketing Certified?</strong></h2>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://biteable.com/watch/embed/dmc-1596075/5175247659fc43a1576747f3693bd7ee7d697926" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<strong>It’s in demand:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As businesses are crying out to tune themselves into digital just because people are more reluctantly depended on the internet for their chores. However, the availability of skilled digital marketers is less in the market. During the decade, the awareness regarding Digital Marketing is rising so as the demand for skilled Digital Marketers. The skills gap that we’re currently seeing shows a <a href="https://digiperform.com/boom-digital-marketing-jobs-india/">total of 180,000 jobs that with the same pace will be available in 2020</a>, but with not enough professionals to fill each of these jobs.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore the demand is greater than the supply which in turn only increases your chances of being hired at a good salary which makes it a good move to make. </span>
<strong>More Job Opportunities:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have said earlier, the demand for a skilled digital marketer is getting on nerves and not only in India itself, worldwide. There are more than 3.9 billion internet users all over the world and very less professional digital marketers to cover them. It’s exceedingly rare to find that there aren’t any job opportunities in the area, as these multinational companies are always hiring on the urge. So you will find the job opportunities everywhere.</span>
<strong>Get More Paid:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, it’s the simple law of supply and demand. Since the demand is so high for your digital marketable services and the supply is so low, the pay will only lead to go up and perhaps even skyrocket. With this to count on, you’ll be able to negotiate your salary with any prospective employer and <a href="https://digiperform.com/get-high-paying-digital-marketing-job/">grab highly paid jobs</a>. This bar is set to high for the next five years. It’s not only the managerial positions that are going through an increase in salary amount. Even entry-level positions are seeing a sizeable increase in salary.</span>
<h2><strong>How can Digital Marketing Certification help?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Enhance your Authorization:</strong> </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Digital Marketing Certified will help you to gain and enhance your authorization at the professional level. It helps to establish knowledge and skill for digital marketing under professional supervision. You can take this as an advantage to gain more opportunities to work at the highly professional organization. </span>
<strong>Keep you updated:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the course, you get the know the basic ideology and concepts of digital marketing. You will learn more about it and stay updated. By learning from Digital marketing institutes, the industry experts can help to strengthen the core concepts of Digital marketing as well.</span>
<strong>Be Startup Expert:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After gaining all the required knowledge about the digital marketing, you can be a startup experts. Digital marketing is an in-demand skill that entrepreneurs have used to launch successful businesses.</span>
<strong>Boost your confidence:</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning new and interesting skills-sets and gaining knowledge can also be an empowering experience; earning a certificate can increase and boost confidence level as you set some new challenging goals.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R0FP-KwacY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The marketing has turned into a glamorous field rather than slaying over the old traditional one. Where ever you see, you will find attractive ways of marketing to grab the attention of the audiences’ as well online visitors. No wonder this glamorous change has become the need of the hour just because of the one aspect- <em>Competition</em>. With the million of the population around the world, everyone, every business dreams to be big and get acknowledged by the world which has turned into lots of turbulence in the playground of competition. Currently, this competition is overwhelmed by current marketing trend, Digital Marketing.
Digital Marketing is the sales promotion and advertising method to promote a brand through electronic media, especially with the help of different online marketing tools available on the internet, which is highly appreciated by business or companies. As per the business experts, it is more dynamic, widespread, and effective than the traditional modes of sales, and marketing. It provides positive results faster than traditional methods, and it is a more flexible form of marketing than the traditional method. As I have well stated what digital marketing is, let me stress on why our business gurus are so much into digital marketing and always recommend every new startup owner to consider digital marketing strategies?
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-12567 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/m2-300x270.jpg" alt="m2" width="384" height="346" />
The best thing about digital marketing is that it provides a multiple of tools in each sector of digital marketing to analyze the result instantly. So, if a marketer is using Google AdSense, he is empowered with a tool to get a complete statistic of its effects, if he is using email marketing, he has a scope to know, how many people are opening his emails. These analytical tools make promotional campaigns more successful, and target oriented.
The basic aspects of Digital Marketing that each businessman must know, use for their businesses to succeed which can turn into marvelous benefits in a very span of time.
<strong>PPC and Google+ Plan</strong>
The businessmen and marketers are still not confident when it comes to using PPC – Pay Per Click to deliver more sales and inquiries and are missing out on the 10-15% of people that click on sponsored Ads. Those are interested are looking for PPC agencies because it may seem them difficult to not only understand how to make the best campaigns strategies but also keep them working and delivering conversions. However, with proper learning and practice, you can win the battle easily. Google Adwords can be a PPC specialist’s best friend because it offers a wide range of solutions, from good keyword search to Display, Remarketing, Shopping, and Video. These give your business a plenty of options when it comes to getting it in front of millions of potential visitors and customers.

When you are using the PPC, you are spending only for actual viewership, which is a very authentic way to reach to the targeted prospects at a minimum cost. Thus, in every aspect, digital marketing tools cost lesser than traditional marketing tools. As per the experts, a greater number of organizations are allocating budgets for digital marketing by curtailing traditional marketing expenses. Therefore, it is cost effective too.
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13529 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ppc1-300x175.png" alt="ppc1" width="551" height="321" />
Google+ might not have gained that much interaction on your social media posts, however; this social media platform plays a crucial role in search engine optimization on the localized level, which makes it a must for marketers. The more reviews you get, the more content you post onto your page and the more followers you obtain, the higher the likelihood that you will start ranking well for localized search terms.

<strong>Email Marketing</strong>
The emails have a major role in any business success. They act as a brand ambassador for your companies. Many businesses have a database of current, prospective or potential customers however they fail to make the most of. Instead of searching for new customers elsewhere, a regular email marketing campaign can help to turn sales leads into customers and existing customers into brand loyalists. One of the best features of email marketing is that it has lower cost as compared to another source of advertising and digital marketing. There are no print costs and no fees in exchange for exposure on a certain billboard, magazines or TV channel. It is easy to create and track.

<strong>Paid Promotions on Facebook, Instagram &amp; Twitter</strong>
Your first job should be to create a Facebook Business Page as there are already 2.01 billion active users on Facebook who are looking for new and reliable sources. However, getting your business in front of Facebook users naturally or organically is becoming far harder, which is why the rise in businesses paying for Facebook ads has increased. These businesses know that just having a simple page that they update is no longer going to cut it and are putting their efforts into tapping into Facebook’s huge audience of daily users unless it gets paid. Facebook offers a range of promotion types, whether you just want to get more “likes” or use them as a conversion driver for your latest product or service. The site’s targeted campaigns may not be cheap, but run correctly can generate significant returns after the few days it can take for the campaign to become fully optimized.

Same case with the Instagram too. If you still haven’t registered your business on Instagram and you’re wondering why Instagram then you are lacking a most of your brand’s visibility. The younger generation has addicted to this social media platform with over 700 million monthly active users. The advertisers are getting more of an opportunity for being on the platform and to share their content through filtered photos. Instagram is one of the most natural ways to share content for your brand.

Twitter is still a great platform where you can grow your following organically. Start searching for hashtags within your industry and reaching out to users in this fashion. Compliment someone on Twitter about a blog post that they wrote. Begin asking questions related to your hashtag. The result will be more interaction and core following of people who are interested in your content! There is a reason why Twitter has nearly 1 billion registered users! Start reaching your target audience via tweets through the perfect Twitter outreach strategy.

<strong>Youtube videos</strong>
