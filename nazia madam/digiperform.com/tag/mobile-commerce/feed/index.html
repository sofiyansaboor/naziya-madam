										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile and the Internet have become an important part of lives for our daily chores. Even the network service providers </span><a href="https://www.signal-boosters.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signal Boosters UK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated the shift that has been expected from desktop to mobile is now imminent. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is expected that by 2021, mobile commerce sales will account for 54% of e-commerce sales, which is astounding. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Believing to the fact, now seems a good time for any business to realize that having a fully functioning, an appealing mobile-friendly site is imperative. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will not only impulse the sales, but it will also ensure the smooth operation of purchasing cycle as it is much easier to purchase the products from mobile as compared to desktop, all because of its mobility. </span>
<img class="wp-image-20289 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic987456.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="336" />
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Mobile Commerce in 2019</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M-commerce</a> (mobile commerce) is the buying and selling of products and services through wireless devices such as smartphones, tablets, desktops, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile commerce in 2019 is expected to grow to heights never imagined before. Statistically speaking, in 2017, mobile commerce accounted for $700bn in revenue, which is more than 300% growth in the last 4 years. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this figure, it is anticipated to continue rising throughout 2019, here are a few key figures demonstrating why every business should be focusing on mobile commerce this year. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research says, 55% of the global population have internet access by the end of 2018. That accounts for 3.2 billion people, and of those, 2 billion are mobile users. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This shows the dominance that mobile commerce could potentially gain through this coming year as well, with such a large number of individuals now using their mobile phones to browse and purchase. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>What does Research say?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pew Research Centre</a> for internet and technology, in 2018, 77% of internet users owned a smartphone, which is a 42% increase from six years ago; again demonstrating the importance of mobile commerce. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, individuals are far less inclined to boot up their PC in order to browse online. As it is far more convenient for them to do so on their mobile phone. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Per month, the average user spends far longer browsing on their smartphone than on their PC. This states the dramatic shift from past user habits, which needs to be acted upon by businesses in 2019. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To build upon this statistic, it has been found that the average person spends over four hours on their smartphone every day, checking it as often as 150 times per day. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These figures again emphasize the importance of a successful mobile commerce campaign, with a lot of potential sales to be made within this area. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>M-Commerce Sales Stats &#8211; 2018</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile commerce sales in 2018 accounted for 34% of total e-commerce sales. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This number is always growing, and by 2021 is expected to account for over half of total e-commerce transactions. This supports the aforementioned statistic, suggesting that users in the modern era are more inclined to browse on their mobile devices, as opposed to on a PC.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact that mobile commerce can have on a company’s profits cannot be underestimated, and it has been shown that if a person has a negative experience on a mobile website when purchasing a product, they are 62% less likely to purchase from that website again in the future.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This illustrates that creating a positive, streamlined customer experience is paramount when discussing why businesses should be focusing their attention on mobile commerce in 2019. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Smartphone Only!</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, it was found that 20% of adults are classed as “</span><b><i>Smartphone only</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” users, meaning they own a smartphone but do not have traditional home broadband services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This may be due to a number of reasons, such as increased pricing for broadband, as well as slower speeds than some LTE 4G networks. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This further implies the significance of mobile commerce, and how essential mobile commerce is shaping up to be within the very near future.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, 67% of individuals admitted to ‘digital window shopping’ on their smartphones, with 77% of these leading to impulse purchases; as established already, convenience is a massive factor when it comes down to mobile commerce. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of mobile searches lead to action within the first hour, which is astonishing when compared to PC users, which takes users a month to reach the same percentage. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer number of users that are now browsing on their mobile phones is enough for any business to realize that this is an opportunity that cannot be overlooked.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a successful, functioning and streamlined app has been shown to increase customer loyalty within mobile commerce. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An Appetitive survey noted that 66% of companies saw a decline in customer loyalty for not having a mobile app. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift that has been apparent for a number of years appears to be coming into fruition, with many consumers turning to their mobile devices for day to day retail habits. </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rise of smartphone ownership globally in 2018, India will have more than 500 million smartphone users where China will have the highest number of smartphone users up to 1.3 billion followed by the US as third with 229 million users. There are about 650 million mobile phone users (using all types of mobile phones) in India where just over 500 million of them have smartphones and internet connectivity, confirmed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and Kantar IMRB.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15872 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/internet-users-300x130.png" alt="" width="800" height="347" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide, more than 50 percent of the world’s population owns a mobile device from which nearly <a href="https://digiperform.com/role-mobile-marketing-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">75 percent of web traffic originates on those mobile devices</a>. Mobile commerce or M-commerce is riding on the wave of smartphone penetration in India. In recent years, e-commerce has taken the World by storm by changing the way we do shopping and online ordering. M-commerce being a newer avatar has further accelerated the pace of growth in online ordering segment considering the usage of smartphones. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With e-commerce and m-commerce working collateral, the World has opened up for both – buyers and sellers. Even sellers who started leveraging mobile platforms have seen their fortunes changing as business gone up multifold. One should go with the trend and the trend has immensely shifted towards the m-commerce. Let’s read more what is m-commerce aka mobile commerce all about. How can it benefit in future? </span>
<b>What is Mobile Commerce?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile commerce, also called </span><b>m-commerce</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is an advancement of E-commerce that enables people to buy and sell products or services and includes monetary transaction completed using mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increase in popularity in e-commerce in earlier decades, it seemed admissible that mobile commerce would be adopted early than expected. Earlier the smartphones were only used for internet browsing, navigation, research, however now it has become the most popular and easy medium of shopping. The e-commerce giants are keen to tap this growing shopping potential and have already launched mobile shopping apps to extend help to mobile internet shoppers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15873 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mobile2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="452" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://magnetoitsolutions.com/infographic/mobile-commerce-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobile Commerce Trends</a> has also served as a trigger for new industries and services or helped existing ones grow, including:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile money transfers.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic tickets and boarding pass.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital content purchases and delivery.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile banking.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contactless payments and in-app payments.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location-based services.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile marketing, coupons, and loyalty cards.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>USPs of M-Commerce:</b>
<b>SEO BENEFITS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; You can also use app indexation tags, letting users download the dedicated app straight from the search results (like Uber has done), or assign the URL schemes within deep app pages, etc.</span>
<b>MOBILE SEARCH EXPERIENCE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; M-commerce pays particular attention to a search box. Convenient on-site search options help users find the desired product easily, avoiding the need to scroll through the pile of irrelevant pages.</span>
<b>TIME-EFFICIENCY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; If customers decide to make a purchase directly through an app, it will take them on average 150% less time as opposed to using the desktop version.</span>
<b>PUSH NOTIFICATIONS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Push notifications are astoundingly more effective than emails. They are instant and difficult to ignore when popping-up on a phone screen. This feature can motivate the customers to be more loyal and provide one more level of engagement.</span>

<b>Role of M-Commerce in E-commerce:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">M-commerce has been gaining popularity with time but still a vast majority of e-commerce owners and retailers are unaware of its tremendous influence. They are still juggling with marketing strategies to create awareness and popularity of their online stores. <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-reasons-ecommerce-can-hugely-boost-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">India’s retail e-commerce sector is small but still growing</a>.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15871 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-12-at-5.39.32-PM-300x170.png" alt="" width="554" height="314" />
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2020, e-commerce sales are expected to total $79.41 billion.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile’s share of e-commerce continues to grow. In 2016, m-commerce sales will total $15.27 billion, making up 65.3% of all e-commerce sales. Those figures will rise to $63.53 billion and 80.0% by the end of the forecast period. Smartphone with the wider adoption of 4G-capable devices and service plans are booming and quite responsible for this growth.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complicated regulations have resulted in the dominance of marketplaces over inventory-model e-commerce sites in India—with Flipkart, Amazon India, Snapdeal and Paytm among the platform leaders. However, the sector is likely on the verge of a wave of consolidation, and Alibaba’s expected entry to the market will have a significant impact.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce in India stands out in terms of how common cash on delivery (COD) is as a payment method. However, mobile wallets and other payment systems have the power to displace COD and have been winning hearts as well with so many cashback offer and feasibility.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Case Study 1: </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are are many companies who even decided to follow </span><b>App-only E-commerce model</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in India, for example, </span><b>Myntra</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bangalore based &#8211; Myntra, India’s leading fashion and lifestyle e-tailer, brought back its mobile website which it had discontinued in May 2015. Nearly 90% of traffic and 70% of the company’s business was happening through its app which led Myntra to take a major step on the solo route of app-only. Myntra claimed to be the first and topmost web-based e-tailer to adopt an app-only model not just in India but globally.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15874 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/myntra-300x176.png" alt="" width="711" height="417" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Myntra launched a new version of its app that allows users to connect with each other for sharing opinions on products, trends, preferences and so on. Every Myntra app user now sees a different landing page based on previous visits, preferences and other social media plugins like Facebook. Myntra, which has close to 20 million app downloads and 7.6 million active customers, offers over 230,000 products from over 1,700 national and international brands. It also has around 10 in-house brands. The firm currently has an annualized gross merchandise value (GMV &#8211; the total value of sales on the platform) of $500 million. It is looking to cross GMV of $1 billion and also become the first major Indian e-tailer to turn profitable in 2016. By 2020, the target is to cross $5 billion GMV.</span>
<b>App-Advantage:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">App only strategy is quite innovative but gutsy move by Myntra notable given to its scale. Apps, of course, come with a long list of advantages for both the companies and customers such as personalization, better user interface, superior customer experience, ability to easily connect anytime and anywhere, rich customer data and so on.</span>

<b>Case study 2: Paytm</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today Paytm is a market leader in both recharge and mobile wallets. It also provided various other facilities like online booking of movies, bus tickets, online ordering payments, wallet money and many more. In case of recharges, they had several Incumbents Like Overcharge in the market. They concentrated in providing as many recharge options on the site and focused what a user really wants.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15875 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paytm-205x300.png" alt="" width="357" height="522" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a customer lands on website or app, he looks for easiest ways to recharge with offers with proper detail or cash back. Most people follow same recharge amounts over and over again as per their usage, for example, these days youngsters are more into Rs 499 prepaid recharge where they get 1GB of data each day with unlimited outgoing for 3 months. These types of recharges last and beneficial for a long time period. Therefore, the app also gives the remainder of the same whenever the recharges are about to expire- just for better user experience. These quick bites only come handy with mobile devices. They have realized a lot of users requested how to keep the money so that they can do repeated recharges without entering bank account details over and over again. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm do 400,000 orders per day, which is the second highest number of Internet transactions. Their core strength is only &#8211; the mobile. More than 50% of the orders are through their mobile app and mobile site, making them the largest mobile commerce platform.</span>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">India is sitting on a goldmine of online shopping which is quite accessible to many people at attractive prices through the handy platform &#8211; mobile. M-commerce is ready to be explored with its unique characteristics of selling the variety of products giving brand shopping in India a new shape and meaning. India is also investing in the internet infrastructure which will help users to explore more in the internet world with the advent of new technologies like 4G finding users in India. </span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/why-is-mobile-commerce-the-next-big-thing-in-2018/">Why is Mobile Commerce &#8211;  the Next Big Thing in 2018?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>
