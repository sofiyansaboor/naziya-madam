			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine your ideal customer deciding how to spend his time and energy. He wants something good with minimal investment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title is the door to your contribution: an invitation that should make the visitor curious, but also contain no false promises (keyword: click-baiting). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title must always be relevant, that is to pack exactly what the visitor may expect after the click. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even if it has already been used a lot, the lists and the number as a numeral are still effective, as the reader can estimate his time and the expected quantity more accurately.</span></p>
<p>When you <a href="https://mycustomessay.com/buy-assignments-online.html">buy assignment</a> from the writing experts you can get help with the title to emphasize one successfully in your writing piece.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title should always explain the direct benefit for the reader. And the keyword should of course happen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your headline caught his attention, emphasizing the value of your proposal. He clicks and reads on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the perfect scenario. But the real battle begins when your client reads the full version of your content. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to make it so attractive that the client not only read all the material but really remains on your page and continues his journey through the funnel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are a few tips to <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-create-effective-digital-marketing-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write content that attract your customers</a>. To know more tricks, You can check out <a href="https://cheetahpapers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheetah Papers</a>.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Tip 1. Do not spam a potential customer:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, we all know that people are busy and a lot of materials are fighting for their attention. However, when the pen reaches for the paper (or fingers for the keyboard), many marketers do not know where to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No secrets needed &#8211; tell them, get them here and why they should stay.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Example here and now</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Why are you here: are you trying to find any incentives for writing content and/or tips on this topic.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Why you should stay: this article has 4 more great tips on <a href="https://digiperform.com/a-guide-to-writing-highly-engaging-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing quality content</a>.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>You don’t have time to get people&#8217;s attention. You need to quickly grab attention and hold it throughout the material.</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your audience most likely does not read, but only views the content. Unlimited Internet resources are available to people, so you need to prove (and quickly) that your article is exactly that article that will stop the user on the run and make him dive into reading.</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">this does not mean that your content must be short or mean. It should be such that people can easily read and understand your message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This implies highlighting in bold subheadings or an important sentence, which will allow them to identify the main idea in about five seconds. You might even need to do some testing to find out how long the materials your customers prefer. Who knows? It is possible that they want to hear a 3,000-word story from you.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Tip 2. Clarity is beyond persuasiveness:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop selling to your audience. Instead, offer real value. In fact, no one wants to read an article that talks about all the wonderful things that you or your company have done. Provide people with eloquent facts, and let them come to this conclusion themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A deliberate sale of oneself in the content evokes exactly the same feelings as in real life. People feel that something is not right here and go on. They may be interested in a more relaxed tone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the blog post aloud (no matter how funny it sounds) &#8211; this will help maintain the natural tone of the conversation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main thing is to understand what you say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not get too carried away with your own marketing genius, office jargon or calls to action and forget about readers. Write so that they understand the text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An easy way to do this is to focus on one major advantage of your product, relate it to the headache of your audience, and sell it. Use words that convey value to your readers so that they never forget for whom the content is.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Tip 3. Find your own perspective:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telling people about an event or what happened is wonderful. But it’s much better to tell them why this happened, how it happened, and who influenced it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when you write a specific case, do not dump the campaign details on the page. Build material around the most interesting aspect of its implementation. Introduce readers to the organization, its employees, the features of working with clients, and most importantly, their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell a story that will emotionally affect your audience and solve its painful problems. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear perspective helps to interest the audience: if the reader can identify with the topic of your article or the problem that drives him, he can get the most out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make things easier, make a clear outline for your content, which you will follow to ensure that you don&#8217;t get lost along the way.</span></p>
<p><strong>How? &#8211; methods, methods, steps, procedures</strong><br />
<strong>What? &#8211; reasons, responses, answers, evidence, evidence, tips, advantages</strong><br />
<strong>Why? &#8211; facts, elements, signs, conclusions, ideas</strong><br />
<strong>When? &#8211; phases, conditions, time, seasons</strong><br />
<strong>Who! &#8211; categories, types, personalities, classes</strong><br />
<strong>Which one? &#8211; options, alternatives, choice, paths, goals, objectives, solutions</strong><br />
<strong>Where? &#8211; sources, spheres, places, sites</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure does not have to be exactly the same, but it must certainly be clear. Clear in terms of the position that underlies the material, as well as the benefits that users are expected to derive from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the content is not to show how smart you or your company is (although this may seem right). The purpose of the content is to make your readers believe that they are smart. Give them something that remains in their heads and what they share over a cup of coffee.</span></p>
<h4><b>Make your customer the hero of your story.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you write short material, such as a post on social networks or a blog, start it with an overview of customer issues. Ask your colleagues about the problem that customers have had recently, and solve it. You will be thanked by clients, as well as colleagues, to whom you will save time.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Tip 4. Use different content formats.</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the degree of attractiveness of your content, sometimes it may not catch the client. This is a flaw in the format you are using. Say you are writing a blog post, and your customers would be more likely to respond to the same video material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-39516 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Content-Marketing-Formats-300x12-1.png" alt="Content marketing formats " width="709" height="284" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s simple. You already have content, just use your mobile phone, webcam or any other recording equipment and tell your customers about it personally. There is no need to make a professional video, in fact, customers may like unprocessed video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not necessary to use a video on a blog. There are many content formats that your customers will respond to &#8211; you just need to test and find out which one is most suitable. Or, if your audience has different tastes, offer the same material in several formats and let the customers choose in what form they want to get to know him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shortlist of common formats:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog Text Posts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EBooks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video (which can be used not only on YouTube but also to redirect in the video post of the blog and share it through social networks)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webinars (which should be maintained and shared on the site through a library of videos available upon request)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webinar presentations distributed through sites such as SlideShare</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infographics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasts</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help you not only with your calendar of publishing content: redirecting one material and presenting it in a format that is preferable for your customers will increase the number of people who will be able to read, listen to or see this content.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Tip 5. Build a house, and it will be populated:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone can publish a post or article, so where does the authority come from? Well, one way is to work hard for years, providing quality, valuable materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a short way &#8211; to borrow a little authority from your customers. Your customers are more likely to believe one of them than you. After all, you are a marketer, and it is your direct task to make your company look good in their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom content is images, videos, and customer texts that give your brand credibility. These materials can be used in your marketing campaigns to connect some consumers with others through your product or service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get high-quality custom content, you can use any of the following tactics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviews;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interaction in social networks;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contests.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Tip 6: Smooth formatting is important:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long texts without paragraphs and loosening up image material are more likely to deter, no matter how well the content is written. In addition, not everyone likes to read. At least not much. Therefore, the content should be packed attractively. Help with:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paragraphs: These should be kept short not very short. But it depends some readers prefer reading even large text if they find them interesting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subheadings: Divide the information into subsections with subheadings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists: This one is an example.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual stimuli: Interrupt longer paragraphs with a medium, such as a graphic, photo, or video.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text formatting: Use all options to format text. Bold should be very few words. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other important words could be italicized or decorated with color. Also, play with the sizes and fonts of the headings.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3><b>Other tips for content marketing:</b></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1. Present your work in all networks:</strong> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your article has finally been published and you proudly present your work in all networks, on all channels. That&#8217;s what the work seems to do, though there are at least two options left to give your good content the deserved attention.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39515 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/share-content-on-social-media-30.png" alt="share content on social media " width="746" height="470" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first trick is simple and free: Share your content more than once. Many are reluctant to do so because they think they are boring their fans, but at different times you can reach a very different set of followers, who will be happy about the hint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the headline, the screenshot, and the descriptive text are varied. If the content was produced so that it is still relevant months later, you can also save your messages (put them in storage) and post them again after about half a year. The second trick is rarely free, but more effective, as the next tip shows.</span></p>
<h4><strong>2. Promote your content:</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search for platforms that serve the same niche. This could be about forums, Facebook groups, online magazines, and blogs. Always pay attention to the respective rules in order not to be excluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your offer is too commercial (if it is clear that a product or service is in the foreground), then offer the operator a fair amount for the promotion to place your content.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3. Self-Critic your work:</strong> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look honestly at your content and ask yourself: Has my article really solved a problem? Am I entertaining or is the content too general and boring?</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Become more personally and represent a point of view, instead of making everyone a &#8220;beautiful face&#8221;. Look at the article from a distance: would I read this article, or even share it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A self-critical look that is not so easy. Of course, we often hear that only the regular production of content brings success. But this content must be (in the truest sense of the word) notable for having a chance to attract attention.</span></p>
<h4><strong>4. Maintain Consistency:</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producing consistently good content is a damn hard job, which often only starts to pay off after a few months. It is a process that requires patience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the commercial area, the recommendation is to continuously capture the problems and questions of the customers and to offer content with solutions that may sometimes be very specific. Such an article will not bring much traffic on its own, but here it does the mass: practically a knowledge database for your industry.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5. Write the way your readers search:</strong> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right choice of words is important to be found by your readers too. When you write an article, you should start using the terms and phrases that you are looking for. This also simplifies the SEO optimization of your articles in the aftermath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that does not mean that you should only write for Google. But use keyword research to find out what terms are actually searched. For example, the abbreviation &#8220;SEO&#8221; is searched twice as often as &#8220;Search Engine Optimization&#8221;. So you should use SEO as a common wording.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are unsure, you should always choose the variant that feels more natural to you. Choose the wording that you think would be more useful to your readers.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Can you write?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This question may seem strange, I&#8217;ll ask it again: <em>Do you really know how to write?</em></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Notice that I am not asking if you are literate. I imagine if you are reading this text right now, you know how to put the letters and words together.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, my question still remains. And do you know why I&#8217;m making such a point of emphasizing this?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, people believe that simply because they can read, they can also write <em><strong>quality content</strong></em>. And here among us, this is not quite true!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing good Digital Marketing Content means strategically thinking about each piece of text you publish, chaining ideas with a specific marketing goal, organizing and structuring all content to guide the reader along your line of reasoning. There are also many <a href="https://www.customwritingservice.com/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">custom writing service</a> providers that can help you to write better</span>
<b>Now, I ask you again: can you write?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re not sure about your answer yet, you&#8217;re in the right place! This post will help you to understand how you can improve your writing skill if you are looking for a job in content writing or content writing jobs for freshers. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/content-writing.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-24291 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/content-writing.jpg" alt="content-writing" width="260" height="260" /></a>
<h2><b>What is Effective Digital Marketing Content?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, before we start giving you the tips on how to produce amazing materials with <a href="https://digiperform.com/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing strategies</a>, let&#8217;s understand what really characterizes them as amazing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some factors that influence the quality of texts and, in addition to their compliance with grammar rules (which cannot be forgotten even in times of autocomplete on smartphones), we must structure and plan everything that will be said to make the text a success.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Proper use of keywords</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Much is said in the midst of digital marketing and SEO about keywords.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early days of search engine studies, it was believed that the search engines were the only thing needed for a text to rank.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was prioritized because of the quality of the content itself, which culminated in a plethora of internet text that meant nothing but was full of keywords and therefore had good rankings on Google.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that this kind of action no longer works. However, keywords are still very important for producing good digital marketing content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They are the expression of doubt that the persona has when it wants to find a specific answer.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is, if you are aiming to address your audience&#8217;s doubts through your <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-chapter-3-how-to-build-a-refined-content-marketing-strategy-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing strategy</a>, you will want to know how this issue is sought by the persona, to be found more often, right?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what keywords do &#8211; when used properly, of course!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the constant <a href="https://digiperform.com/google-seo-updates-the-past-present-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updates of Google&#8217;s algorithm</a>, more and more quality content with semantic value is valued.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, using keywords in content only means that you are choosing a goal for your text, that is, you are defining that particular piece will solve that doubt that is conveyed through the keyword.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Read, re-read and read one more time</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic parts of the text, such as title and keyword, the writer should read all the information that is offered to him, such as the entire client strategy, the data from the persona, the description of the agenda, and the most technical information.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, this is all on the agenda for one simple reason: for you to read and write the best content possible in the right context.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So read all that is offered before you write and during the production process to keep the data at hand. If you have any questions, come back and check it out. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t write anything without being sure of the quality of your material, ok?</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Create your text skeleton</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve done all the research you can and read everything you could read about the company&#8217;s strategy, it&#8217;s time to get your hands dirty!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step, then, should be to make the skeleton of your text, ie the backbone of the content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is, before you start spitting words on a blank page, make a small draft. Here are some guidelines that can help you with this process:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the actual document where you will develop the text, write the customer information and the text that you consider most important at the time of writing (for example, some language specificity to use or relevant data you found in some reference).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, create a basic hierarchy between topics, establishing which topics are most important and which should be listed as subtopics. This step will help you with the SEO of your text, as these hierarchical topics can already become your headlines.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Write your digital marketing content</b></span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To get the best possible result from your text, pay attention to its Copywriting, ie the techniques that will make the reader get the most out of your text.</span>
<h4><b>Some of the guidelines for following these techniques are:</b></h4>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use training methods to draw the reader&#8217;s attention to specific points in your text, such as bold, italics, and underline ;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Break the text into headings  to make it easier for anyone reading to assimilate your line of reasoning;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link to other blog articles so the reader can expand their knowledge of the subject from your text;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use persuasive languages ​​when inviting you to take action, such as CTA.</span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research more on the subject, I&#8217;m sure you will get good ideas on how to improve your content from these techniques.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Don&#8217;t forget to review</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a critical point in developing good content and many writers forget it. The revision is the moment when you can see if your entire initial plan, which was set out in the text skeleton, was actually followed.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should check that you have not passed any <a href="https://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/learning-grammar.html" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">grammar</a> errors, and search data not linked to the source, or even any language addiction that should not be used in the content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To revise in a slightly less addictive way, when you finish writing your text, take a break. Go read a book, or go for a walk. Then, take it to review.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will make it easier to see errors that could go straight if you revise it as soon as you have finished the text.</span>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing audience-engaging content can seem like a tricky task. Now, with <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing</a> becoming more and more prevalent, it&#8217;s more important than ever to create engagement with your content.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The content that you create, whether it&#8217;s on a blog or social media, should always make the reader want to read it &#8211; and connect with it. Otherwise, your efforts risk being wasted.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re finding it difficult, or you&#8217;re not getting the engagement that you want, here are top tips to creating engaging, thoughtful content &#8211; that will be sure to give you the results you&#8217;re looking for.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this guide when you&#8217;re creating your content strategy.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Start with market research</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is, every target demographic will react to content in different ways. For instance, baby boomers will more than likely scroll past specific posts for millennials and vice versa.  </span>
<a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/social-media-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24091 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/social-media-usage-generation.jpg" alt="social-media-usage-generation" width="529" height="428" /></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Discovering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who your target audience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is, their demographics, and their interests are the first step to creating content &#8211; that works for you. It&#8217;s irrelevant what works for other company&#8217;s because they have a completely different goal to you.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dive into your own market research, check out competitors, and maybe even conduct surveys. From this, you can create content that works for your audience.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><strong>Originality is the key  </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know, creating content that hasn&#8217;t been done before, in some form, is really difficult. 100% unique content is actually next to impossible.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the internet, there&#8217;s likely a blog, image, or video that&#8217;s similar to what you had in mind. That&#8217;s completely fine.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to be original with the way you conduct it. Your content should stand out, and should not look like a copy &#8211; rather, it should be your own version of something.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can still write a blog post about a prevalent topic, but do it in your own words. Add your own unique spin to it. Perhaps even share personal experiences, and include your brand throughout.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being </span><a href="https://www.textbroker.com/unique-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">original and authentic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you&#8217;ll undoubtedly grow a loyal group of readers and followers.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><strong>Master your headlines </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating compelling, engaging headlines is another crucial aspect of writing audience engaging content. It&#8217;s that initial attraction that pulls them in, right from the start.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Headlines are so important &#8211; they always have been with written content. It might not be fair, but the majority of people decide to read something, just form looking at the headline. Which makes it all the more important to master.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t give too much away in your article, then they have no reason to click on it. Keep people guessing with &#8220;the reason why&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;X tips to.&#8221; People will have a reason to consume your article that way.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This actually is very similar to how you should write your YouTube and podcast titles, too.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few services you can use to create impressive headlines:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://studicus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studicus.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a service that hires seasoned professionals with a marketing and sales copywriting background.</span></li>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few examples in the image. You can tweak them as per your preferences as well. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot-2019-09-06-at-5.21.38-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24090 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot-2019-09-06-at-5.21.38-PM.png" alt="examples of blog titles" width="551" height="393" /></a>
<h2><strong>Make your content actionable  </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you want the reader to click on your article? What should they do afterward? If you don&#8217;t tell your reader, they&#8217;ll never know.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re promoting a new product, make sure you include descriptions and links throughout.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want people to follow your Instagram, read your next blog post, or sign a petition &#8211; make sure you make it clear throughout.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t worry, if your reader has clicked on your article, chances are, these demands won&#8217;t be off-putting for them. Obviously, keep them all relevant and don&#8217;t push too much in a sales-like way. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><strong>Perfect your storytelling skill </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People like to read and relate more to stories, in comparison to data being shoved at them.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why we read books, watch movies, and indulge in documentaries. It&#8217;s easier and more entertaining than reading statistics off a slide.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, you need to amp up your storytelling skills and connect with your audience on a deeper level.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s use a hypothetical situation. Say you&#8217;re an e-commerce store that sells natural alternatives to medicine. If you tell stories of how your &#8220;peaceful tea&#8221; helps with sleeping, it&#8217;s much more useful than listing ingredients and prices.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As humans, our brains react positively to storytelling, this includes a release of dopamine. We have emotional connections to stories, and for that reason, you should not shy away from doing so.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your stories are relevant and authentic. There are a few places where you can find out how to properly integrate storytelling in your content — there is a great guide on storytelling on </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/storytelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HubSpot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also the writers at </span><a href="https://www.trustmypaper.com/paper-writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust My Paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can offer consultation on the topic.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><strong>Give your audience something to think about  </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Produce content that will leave a mark on your audience&#8217;s brain. Again, market research comes in really handy with this tip, as you need to make sure your article relates to them.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask rhetorical questions, paint abstract pictures, and leave your audience with thoughts. From a marketing point of view, this will keep your brand on their mind and might make them come back.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, this type of thought-provoking content absolutely helps with engagement. People are much more likely to comment and share with people and ask for their opinion.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, this is a great way to increase engagement and boost traffic to your site. A win-win situation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t forget about the graphics  </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know this is all about written content &#8211; where on earth do graphics come into this? However, pictures and visuals need to be incorporated. Otherwise, it might not be successful.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important to use related images, as supporting content. Even using bar charts or pie charts for supporting statistics is a great idea.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These pictures should be high-quality, relevant, and engaging themselves. This way, they will add to the conversation and make it easier to engage with.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog posts without images seem too text-heavy and might be off-putting for some readers.  </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot-2019-09-06-at-5.31.13-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24092 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot-2019-09-06-at-5.31.13-PM.png" alt="" width="433" height="410" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><strong>Keep the content flexible </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You shouldn&#8217;t keep publishing the same posts, again and again, and again. Readers will become bored and result in not engaging or interacting with them. It could even lead to a loss of followers.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re in an industry which seems to niche for versatility, you will be mistaken. There are tonnes of topical topics to touch on, which will create diversity around your content.   </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you&#8217;re in the construction industry &#8211; you could produce content on sustainability, a how-to-guide, and an interview with an industry master. You see how it mixes it up a little bit.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re planning on creating a series, you should still split these posts up with different pieces. Or at least post them with a week break in between.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h2><strong>Keep the reader interested from the start </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well done on creating a fantastic headline &#8211; but now you have to make sure they carry on reading the rest of the content. Just because they click on your post, doesn&#8217;t mean they will read through the entire piece.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has shown that 55% of readers only spend 15% reading articles &#8211; in other words, they&#8217;re skim reading.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Write an intro that makes the rest of the article alluring. Perhaps ask a question, or entice people in by offering them something.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this is where storytelling comes in handy too.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This guide to writing audience-engaging content should help you throughout your content strategy. By creating content that engages and attracts, you&#8217;ll assuredly gain new readers and increase your profits.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of all these tips, and make sure your content is accurate and up-to-date. Avoid anything controversial because, in the age of the internet, bad engagement isn&#8217;t a positive sign. </span>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a part of the digital agency where I work with various clients each day, it’s very common to hear them saying, &#8220;<em>What is the role of SEO in my business? How impactful is SEO in our marketing strategy?</em>’</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many companies and newly born startups are aware of the fact that <em>SEO is important for their businesses</em> but they fail to look beyond investing in just advertising. This kind of approach restricts them from taking full advantage of their marketing efforts.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For business willing to consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbound_marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inbound Marketing</a>, it’s very simple to understand how impactful is SEO and how exactly it fits their marketing strategy.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO and Inbound Marketing have their separate roles to play; however, SEO plays a major part in Inbound Marketing.</span>
How? I&#8217;ll share the reasons in this post. Before that, l<span style="font-weight: 400;">et’s take a quick look at them as separate entities and then dive deeper to understand how they are connected.</span>
<h2><strong>What is Inbound Marketing?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple words, <em>Inbound Marketing is a collaborative effort of employing various digital marketing techniques to attract potential customers to your business before they are even ready to make a transaction or payment</em>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major focus is given on creating and sharing content especially designed for target prospects.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing strategies like <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content Marketing</a>, PPC, SEO, Social Media, etc. come with their unique metrics analyzed by different teams which collaborate to work toward the same goal. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can think of it like a government where each department has a specific focus, but together they work towards a single goal – prosperous development of the country. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Inbound marketing tactics include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Marketing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email Marketing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User experience on the website</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more</span></li>
</ul>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/types-ogf-inbound-marketing.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-23208 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/types-ogf-inbound-marketing.jpg" alt="types of inbound marketing" width="604" height="341" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because inbound marketing is broad, you might be overwhelmed on how to choose the right one for your business. Essentially, you want to seek help from one of the reputable </span><a href="https://www.310creative.com/services/inbound-marketing-agency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inbound marketing agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An inbound marketing agency is a company or business that recruits the services of a third-party firm to help promote and market a product, a service, or a brand. This can be done by using an inbound marketing firm as a medium between the company and the target audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of inbound marketing include the following:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your customer base</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your business’ size </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase in profit</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different types of inbound marketing. The three most common are search engine optimization, direct mail, and video marketing.  </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct mail is an important tool in the promotion of a product or service. This is where mail is sent to the recipient in a specific shape or format that’ll entice the receiver to open it. </span>The advantage of this kind of advertising is it’s cheap and effective. Also, they’ll be able to give an immediate response. When a recipient opens the envelope, they can read the contents of the mail.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video marketing is one of the newest forms of advertisement. This can be done by using videos uploaded online to broadcast to people across the globe. This kind of marketing allows the customer to experience the products, services, or brand for themselves.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking for an inbound marketing company, ask about their credentials and their track record in the field. Make sure that they offer a high level of service. If they’re unable to answer your questions, you should look for another agency. Don’t hesitate to ask a lot of questions especially about their methods, their experience, and the way they would handle a particular campaign.</span>

<h2><strong>So, What is SEO?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is an aspect of digital marketing concerned with increasing traffic to your website. It serves the website with high quality and relevant traffic through <strong>organic</strong> search.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s understand what exactly SEO depicts,</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Quality Traffic</strong> – Attracting a lot of traffic to the website can be done in any circumstances. But, what really matters is the quality of traffic. Let’s say your agricultural website sells Apples and you are receiving traffic which wants to buy Apple mobiles and laptops, that is not quality traffic. So, you want to attract relevant potential customers who are genuinely interested in the products &amp; services that you offer.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Organic Traffic</strong> – It is a type of traffic where you do not have to pay for.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, once you start getting relevant traffic through organic means, your website authority gets better.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, there have been many <a href="https://digiperform.com/google-seo-updates-the-past-present-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updates in the Google algorithm</a> of how the search engines collect data and give us results for the user queries. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, when the algorithm was still naive, businesses were able to use tactics that tricked search engines and ranked higher in the SERPs (search engine result page). </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, today it is very treacherous as the algorithm has become highly intelligent and you could be penalized for using unfair means to rank higher.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, SEO practices have evolved in such a way that it prioritizes users over the search engines.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s look at the real deal.</span>
<h2><strong>Content and SEO – How they go together?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To better understand how SEO content and inbound marketing are related, we first need to address the codependency between Content, SEO and Inbound marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content is at the core of any inbound marketing strategy and, SEO is dependent on content. To put it simple words, SEO is the essence of inbound marketing and content is the essence of SEO. You can call it a TRIO.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content and SEO are so closely related that they are inseparable today. Since search algorithms prioritize users over search engines, the main focus of any SEO strategy should be <em><strong>high quality and relevant content</strong></em> that will appeal to the users.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To optimize the content for SEO, here are 5 essential tactics one should follow,</span>
<h4><strong>Before you even pick a pen or hit that keyboard – Do Your Keyword Research</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword research is the most important aspect of any inbound marketing strategy. It is concerned with finding the search terms users insert on search engines. With proper keyword research, you will get an idea of keyword volume and trends that are out there. You can use various <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-20-seo-tools-for-business-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEO tools</a> like SEMRush, Google Keyword Planner, etc to do your research. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/keword-planner-example.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23212 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/keword-planner-example.png" alt="keword planner example" width="651" height="368" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the main sections on your website, keywords with higher volume can be chased while the sub-sections could use more long-tail keywords.</span>

<h4><strong>(LSI)Latent Semantic Keywords or Related Keywords</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are researching for keywords, you’ll come across keywords related to the services or products you offer. It is advisable to create a list of these terms since they come into play when just the writing is focused on.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">LSI keywords also play an important role as users initially don’t have an exact idea of what they want and are in the research phase.</span>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Title Tags</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The title is the first thing people notice about your content and business online. An engaging title captures the attention of the users; thus increasing the chances of them clicking and visiting your website.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping SEO in mind, focus keywords should be placed as close to the front as possible and limiting the titles under 60 characters should be standard practice. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their main purpose is to,</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate curiosity</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak about what readers have in mind</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish credibility</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentions the benefit of your products/services </span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Creating Content</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can consider the content as a knowledge bank where the visitors get their questions answered. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, you can draft the content by writing down the most important thoughts and decide the sub-heads using the focus keywords. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to worry about being grammatically correct or the readability. You can use Grammarly Tool for the grammar. Just focus on the theme and what should you include to address the intent. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After you have created the first draft, you can proceed by organizing the content. Keeping in mind readability and word count (&gt;300), segment the draft using header tags (H1, H2, and so on), bullet points, infographics, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While you do this, it’s important to keep the keyword density between 2% to 8% as you could be penalized otherwise.</span>

<h4><strong>Meta-Description</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta-description plays a very important role in the strategy. It’s an opportunity to write a description that summarizes the title. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Good Meta-description increases the chances of the user clicking and visiting your business. The more the CTR (Click-through rate), the greater the chance of people end up using services or buying products that you offer.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said since search engines display first 150 &#8211; 166 characters of the description, it is advisable to keep it under that limit.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/meta-descriptipn.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-23213 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/meta-descriptipn.jpg" alt="meta description" width="581" height="450" /></a>

<h2><b>So, how do you measure content marketing ROI? </b></h2>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue from upsells</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Is there any formula to calculate content marketing ROI?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take a simple calculative way to measure the content marketing ROI from <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convince and Convert</a>:</span>
<span style="color: #993300;"><b><i>“Return minus investment, divided by investment, expressed as a percentage”.</i></b></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example,</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone has spent $500 on creating a piece of content, and receiving leads worth $2000, then your ROI is 300%:</span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$2000-$500 = $1500</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1500/$500 = 3</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">3 x 100% = 300%</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Conclusion:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it’s difficult to show how content marketing is performing and generate ROI, these metrics can give you a better sense of performance and how your content is helping with the goals.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By putting the right content with the right tactics, you will be able to generate more traffic, lead and sales to please your businesses or bosses. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, content marketing is worth an investment.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost motive of any content marketing strategy is to captivate the target audience, educate them and convert them into customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, no wonder, all the content creators give their heart and soul to create such kind of unique and valuable content that definitely helps businesses to achieve their end goals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kudos to all the content creators!</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, who has less idea what is content marketing all about, we are here to help. </span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free beginner’s guide to content marketing</a>, we have been sharing basic elements related to content marketing, especially for beginners. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, we have shared:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How content marketing plays an important role in a business success? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various ways to create a content marketing strategy? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is content marketing related to marketing funnel? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to identify your audience for content marketing strategy? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various tools that can help you generate effective content for the same?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all these efforts won’t give desired results if none of these have appropriate Call-to-Action (CTA) triggers. Yes, you have read right!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, if your motive to share the content is to bring visitors to the website, then you will use a trigger (CTA) to land your audience to your websites. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Same way, whenever you receive an email stating any shopping sale, you might have noticed </span><b>Call-to-Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing to the website or app. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These action buttons help target audience to land upon the right designated path and give you the successful campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this chapter of beginner’s guide to content marketing, we will be sharing how Call-to-Actions play an important role in any content marketing success. What are the basic steps you need to keep in mind while creating the content? How to create a compelling call-to-action for your content marketing strategy?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19066 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/call-to-actions.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="254" /></span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have stated earlier, Call-to-action helps to captivate the target audience as well as increase the conversions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not all the call-to-action can give you the success rate.  Most of the content marketers aren’t using effective CTAs to target the ideal audience and convert them as happy customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look into business website stats, only 30% of businesses are using appropriate CTAs to engage their ideal customers. Rest, 70% of business sites lack call-to-action. This is devastating. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our content creators aka marketers need to understand the importance of CTAs in their marketing strategy and how they (CTAs) help them to increase their open as well as success rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging a prospect to take desired actions as per your marketing strategy may seem the hardest task for marketers, but is not unachievable. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to create informative content for your readers that can solve their problems and serve your purpose. You need to focus on creating a beautiful attractive content design and more &amp; more powerful as well as compelling Call-to-Action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers look for easy and understandable </span><b>Clickable Button</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than a confusing action. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are CTAs?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call-to-Action</a> which are the clickable buttons basically used on your website, landing pages, emails, blogs, etc to guide your readers or visitors towards your goal conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the part of your content that the user needs to click in order to take the action you want them to take.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the question comes, why marketers fail to convert readers to customers. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does wrong in creating a compelling call to action? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What goes into a strong CTA? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the basic things you need to keep in mind while creating an effective CTA for your marketing strategy?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s read further: </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Choose a Goal:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, decide why you need to CTA and what are your purpose to use the following CTA? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should your call to action button is to generate webinar sign-ups or you want your readers to download the ebook? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your audience to share your content or want to land up to your website? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason can be any…..</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, decide your goal and write your appropriate CTA based on your content strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, of course, use the desired actionable link so that the reader can the desired action with minimal hassle.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19069 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ctaa.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="399" />
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Consider the Context:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the place of your reader or prospect in the current marketing cycle. Does your reader knows about your product already or it’s the first time that you have introduced your services to them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it won’t make a sense if your reader is landing for the first time on your homepage to get a CTA about buying an expensive product. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, understand the level and accordingly set your CTA. For example, if you are selling some audio product, in such case, use CTA as “Request a Demo” or “Learn More” instead of using “Buy Now”.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-19070 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/calltoaction-example.png" alt="" width="575" height="362" />
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Make to Short &amp; Precise:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember on the golden rule of using CTAs. Using multiple calls to actions buttons in one piece of content can ruin the whole information, lower your conversion rate and confuse your readers as well. Also, wordy CTAs can get easily ignored. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use short and precise CTAs to make your content more effective. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days our readers are more knowledgeable and understand that a hyperlink or button is intended to click. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, Instead of guiding them saying “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here to register for our free webinar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”; use or state “</span><b><i>Register for our free webinar</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which is likely to have a stronger impact.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-19071 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/with-date-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="279" />
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Place CTA Strategically:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While creating valuable content, the marketer should know where to place the CTA in the content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always recommended not to use CTA in the middle of your content, that probably will confuse your readers and distract them from your valuable content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always place a call to action at the end of the content body when the message of your content is delivered. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2></h2>
<h1><b>How to create a compelling call to action?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content creators invest a lot of time in generating problem-solving content for their readers or give ultimate efforts into your online marketing strategy, but they forget to give focus on research of appropriate Call-to-Actions which led to less conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are getting traffic on your content but no conversions, then this is the high time to look into your “How to club perfect CTA in the content” strategy. </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are few tips to create a compelling call to action for your content.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Direct</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop looking for indirect ways to convert your audience. State clearly what is the purpose of sharing the content. Stop beating around the bush.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your content / your website / your business is valuable that should be in direct in approach. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be precise and tell your visitors what you do and what exactly you would like them to do.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Call to Action must be simple, short and strong.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure there is no room to play guessing games for your visitors or readers to get confused or clueless. Use straightforward examples in a positive way like ‘get started,’ ‘sign up,’ ‘submit,’ or ‘download’.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Unique</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a marketer, you already aware how it is crucial to be unique and stand different in the crowd if you want to beat the competition. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find something that makes your call-to-action special; it could be ridiculously simple or something that aggravates a problem.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Use Actionable Language</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use action words that compel or motivate your visitors to do what you want them to. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, “</span><b><i>Call us today for a free sample</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” will make them curious to have or try at least Free sample which seems a good call to take an action. You are giving clear direction to the reader using the action-  “Call”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other ways, you can say like “Give us a call for a free demo”  but it seems less actionable then previous one. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Urgent</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CTAs you use in your content must create the urgency so that visitors take the action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The agenda is to convey the message that your readers are missing out the great opportunity that should be theirs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like one example we have used earlier. “Call us today for a free sample” denoted more urgency instead of “Give us a call for a free demo”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Call us today create the urgency that they can miss out the great deal to use the free sample or demo than later one stating or requesting to give a call for the free demo. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both have a slight difference but the way you approach matter a lot in your CTAs. While “today” is a good word to add in your call to action, using “now” or “immediately” is even better. These words imply a greater urgency and also make it clear that the offer may not last forever.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Call-to-Action Example</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Netflix</b></span></h2>
<b>CTA Button: Join Free for a Month</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19065 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-15-at-11.09.56-PM.png" alt="" width="555" height="347" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever a new user feels to sign up any new program, he/she fears to commit as it will be the pain to cancel their subscription if they end up not liking it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix has been running various campaigns stating not to fear to cancel the subscription by saying “Cancel Anytime” along with “Join Free for a Month&#8221; CTA with full assurance. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This assurance alone has boosted unlimited sign-ups where you notice that the red color of the primary and secondary CTAs here match Netflix&#8217;s logo color.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bravo!</span>
&nbsp;
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an effective call-to-action takes creativity, time, practice and lots of research.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that it needs to be simple enough so that users can easily understand your message.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the content and CTA should be compelling enough to persuade them to do what you want them to do.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, don’t feel afraid to be experimental and see what works best for your audience.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are a marketer or entrepreneur, you should know these basics if you want your business at top notch. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a content creator,  you may think or likely convinced that you know about your target audience inside and out. However, how often as a marketer you thought and do your data based audience research? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the answer is “</span><b><i>rarely</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “</span><b><i>no</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, that you need to deeply figure out how deeply you can work it out to club this as the “must to-do-task” into your to-do list to determine the cross-channel audience. This will not only nurture your knowledge while creating content, but it will also help you to make content marketing efforts successful. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Things To Keep In Mind While Identifying Your Audience</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Social Media, Audiences and Content Marketing &#8211; All are connected</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create </span><b>content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the help of content marketing tools, you share your content through </span><b>social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach out maximum active </span><b>audiences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These three (highlighted ones) are immensely connected with each other and quite dependent on each other as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you publish your content on blogs or create audios/videos, you need the distribution of the same content through multiple platforms to get deserved recognition. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where social media platforms play its role. Though building an audience online is possible only with a deep understanding of the online communities on each platform separately. As each social media platform as a different role to play in building the audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, these platforms work as a network as the source of a huge amount of granular audience differentiated on the basis of demographics, gender, interests, or education level, etc. Though this differentiation may sound weird in the beginning they can help to steer your content marketing strategy in the right direction. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>How does audience analysis can help you plan a successful content marketing strategy?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience analysis can play the role of a compass in an ever-changing but challenging content marketing world. As different content and social media trends, such as cinematography or stories, visual content come and go, however, the knowledge of your audience can help you to stay on track and feel connected with your followers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While studying social media analysis, it allows you to understand which piece of content is well appreciated by them. Also, it helps to experiment which format seem interested to your audience. You can use these insights to plan a long-term content strategy and organize your content-production teams more efficiently. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you are into e-commerce, then your audience would cherish <a href="https://digiperform.com/why-is-visual-content-important-for-your-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual content</a> in the form of pictures and videos rather than simple text blogs. What can you do with this piece of information? Well, you will be able to build an effective <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-chapter-2-how-content-marketing-relates-to-marketing-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing funnel</a>.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18840 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" alt="" width="375" height="375" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your audience allows you to create any form of content for each stage of your content marketing funnel strategy. We always suggest creating compelling visual content as it helps you to achieve the best results and your business objective which ultimately leads to end goal &#8211; </span><b>Conversion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as the </span><b>Happy Customer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h2><b>How to identify your audience for content marketing strategy?</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Conduct Market Research</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you really want to know your audience, all you need is to conduct a complete market research. Ideally, the market research helps to get as many details as possible about the group you’re targeting. This information you can also use later to build personas.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to do your research. Like you can make your action plan as per the <a href="https://digiperform.com/visual-content-marketing-statistics-marketers-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual content marketing statistics</a> available on the internet which gives you a binary idea about your market and the way the audience prefer to watch &amp; interact with. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of marketing tools can help you gather an abundance of data about your target audience. These digital marketing tools range in price but can provide assist you in building a foundation of information, ranging from basic demographic data to specific habits and interests.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you can do brainstorming with your teammates, reach out to other departments like a sales team. They have the practical insight that also helps you to understand the buying behavior of your audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, sit with digital marketing SEO department, they are very keen on marketing insights that will help to make strategies according to audience behavior. (SEO department will help to provide insight into the words customers use and what concerns are commonly brought up.)</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Research Social Networks</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Social networks are the best way to read your customer’s minds and behavior. This action plan is termed as </span><b>Social Listening</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which consists of monitoring the various social networks to discover that is being said about the brand, your competitors stand in the market and comparison along with topics relevant to your business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can even identify trends in your audience’s interests and problems. With the same study, you can identify their preferable platforms to communicate where you can listen to their social conversations as well as determine what type of content will be the most valuable and relevant to them.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Create Your Own Survey</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys can be very helpful when you want to gather more information about your audience as per the general demographics. Demographics, such as age, gender, income level, education, employment, etc. helps you to understand your audience at the next level and prepare your strategies accordingly.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.22.52-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18937 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.22.52-PM.png" alt="" width="520" height="422" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through surveys, you can survey a large population of interest, such as your existing customer base or potential market. The idea of surveying should process through online only. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience is more active on online platforms. With online surveys, the data is you obtain is quantified and gives you statistical results about your population. It reflects trends and commonalities (instead of individually) among your audience.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Build &amp; Identify Audience Personas You’re Targeting</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you collect various types of data from your audience, the next step for you to start building your audiences’ persona. Marketers, as well as content creators who use the study of these personas, achieve 73 percent higher conversions in their marketing strategy.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A persona is more than a buyer’s profile. A buyer persona is the representation of your prospect (ideal customer) based on market research and actual data about your existing customer base.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.24.36-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18938 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.24.36-PM.png" alt="" width="463" height="394" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a persona help to differentiate between the real and abstract audience. That will help you create right targeting content for them and engage in genuine conversations with your current and potential customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, It isn’t enough to just list down the personas and differentiate them into categories. Describe them in detail and describe each one.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can club basic demographic data along to categorize personas, but also other relevant information, such as the person:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interests</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain points</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priorities</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personality traits</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>The Takeaway</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your target audience plays a huge role in setting up and creating your content marketing efforts for a successful marketing campaign. Analyzing audience data, both across social media channels and with the help of other forms of collecting audience, should be the first step in creating an impactful content strategy that will help you achieve your business objectives.</span>

However, there are many marketers who don’t know the importance of content marketing and how innovative content can make a distinction their business success. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Current digital technologies are impacting our traditional marketing funnel and marketers are still figuring out to do best to fit into same. However, they need to understand that the old marketing sales funnel has been changing to a content marketing funnel (in reality) which many brands are still doing their best to figure out. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can look for the easiest ways to support sales by targeting each part of the funnel with a unique and innovative visual content. The visual stage-specific content will help to qualify, nurture, and convert visitors or leads into paying customers.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are still figuring out what this marketing funnel all about? How content marketing relates to traditional marketing funnel? How does this content marketing funnel works? What are the content marketing stages? How you can use to create your own marketing strategies for businesses? Then the answers to your all questions lie here. Let&#8217;s dig out the one by one to understand it in better. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What is Marketing Sales Funnel?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing sales funnel commonly known as </span><b>Sales Funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>Revenue Funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consists of the following stages:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awareness</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decision</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Brand awareness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feeds the top of the funnel through various mediums like TV, newspapers, word to mouth, pamphlets, radios, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You let your audience/people moving through the funnel by getting them </span><b>interested</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through awareness. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you make them interested, they make a </span><b>decision</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and takes the </span><b>Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/marketing-funnels.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18841 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/marketing-funnels.png" alt="" width="453" height="453" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A funnel that has a low conversion rate which is why it is called a “</span><b>leaky funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Where the leak takes place in those four stages tells marketers or businessmen to what layer of the funnel needs work on. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big problem with the traditional sales funnel is that it really doesn’t address how modern consumers and make them buy.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, when it comes to content marketing funnel, the marketers or companies don’t know how to create content? How content marketing, as well as companies, can come together and work like one? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers ask questions like:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many blog posts should I write?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How often should I be tweeting every day?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a specific percentage of my budget that I should be spending on video?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I really need to write white papers and ebooks?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">So, what is Content Marketing Funnel?</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose to generate various kind of content is to convert visitors into actual customers. The same been is encouraged by a content marketing funnel which is a system that helps to convert as many leads into customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through step by step content flow, the marketer can gain as many as potential customers to pay for your products or services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales funnel has a major flaw that there are chances people are your leads or potential customers, however, there are fewer chances they would actually buy your product due to leakage. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The leakage is there are chances that as potential customers move through the funnel towards the much narrower neck (as mentioned in the picture), many will drop off.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome this leakage, the content marketing funnel has made a little variation in the actual sales marketing funnel. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Its basic agenda is to make sure the smaller number of leads will actually make it through the entire funnel and become paying customers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A content marketing funnel has three broad stages:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Awareness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – when a lead or visitor first discovers your brand </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Evaluation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – when a qualified lead (or potential customer) decides to find out whether your product or service is the right fit or not</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Purchase</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – this is the stage every business desperately wants to achieve when the prospect gathers the last bit of information they need before deciding to buy and becomes a customer.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there should be another stage that every marketer or business should dare to achieve which can be clubbed as the fourth stage in the funnel i.e., </span><b>Happy Customers.</b>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18840 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Happy Customers</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses consider sales/conversion as the last stage of marketing funnel which is absolutely wrong. </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales may seem the ultimate goal but the strong and happy customer relationship is the foundation of any business. </span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the marketer should believe in this stage of the funnel and put more focus on Happy Customers than awareness and consideration. They will directly go to conversion especially when it comes to small businesses.  </span>
<h4><em><strong>Don’t agree, let’s take a look:</strong></em></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In your marketing plans, you have only or around 5% chance to sell your product or services to a new customer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you have an existing happy customer, there are 60-70% chance to sell the same product or services to a repeat customer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree every business needs to work on to get new customers. However, your marketing strategy should be designed in such a way where you can target your new audience as well remarket your happy customers again.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been stated that 65% or more of a small business’ revenues come in through existing customers. You agree or not, a little 5% reduction in customer defection can increase revenues by 100%.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketers as well businesses need to work on strategies where they can target to retain their old customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, only 32% of companies are trying to retain their customer. Rest yet need to focus on that. Competition is serious. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What type of Content Goes with Content Marketing Funnel?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the real question arises: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of content belongs at which stage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span>
