										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re running an online business, it’s important to know that you’re in a very competitive industry. Thus, in running your business, you need to ensure that you&#8217;re on top of the game with your marketing strategies. Else, you&#8217;ll only be left behind.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the online business industry is very profitable, this means that marketing trends and techniques are continually changing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What you may have previously known to be effective can already be obsolete at present. One way for you to be right on track with these updates is through the help of a </span><a href="https://www.makeyourmarkdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia digital marketing agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-24588 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14438818027_85f923d0b9_b.jpg" alt="digital marketing" width="625" height="306" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are more benefits when hiring a digital marketing agency: </span>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><b> Improves Your Business From The Very Beginning</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In trying to improve the overall performance of your online business, it starts with the basics. One of the very first benefits that you can gain from hiring a digital marketing agency is that it brings you back to the basics. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before going for more technical and complicated digital marketing solutions, digital marketing agency evaluates everything about your business from the start. In that manner, you&#8217;re able to solve whatever problems you&#8217;re creating at the foundational level. This means that you&#8217;re not just working through with the marketing of your online business at the surface.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s imperative to go back to the very beginning so that you can solve whatever problems that may have been moving at a negative cycle. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because they’re experts in this field, the digital marketing agency can go back to the basics in evaluating the needs of your brand. Then, it works their way up slowly towards </span><a href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/advantages-and-disadvantages-digital-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating powerful strategies for your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Gives You Marketing Expertise At Its Best</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/top-100-digital-marketing-agencies-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital marketing agencies</a> aren&#8217;t in that industry for nothing. It took them years to master their marketing skills. They continue to update and hone their skills, as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the most recent updates are, they’re the first ones to know about it. Hence, when you indulge yourself in their services, they&#8217;re able to apply this to your online business. This gives you that added edge in the competition.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While you may have an in-house marketing team, it&#8217;s still best for you to have a digital marketing agency helping you out from time-to-time. In that manner, the agency is also able to train your marketing team with the best strategies to apply for your business.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24590 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/digital-marketing-team.jpg" alt="digital-marketing-team" width="672" height="385" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Helps You In Content Creation</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In establishing your online presence, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing</a> is the key</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you&#8217;re running an online business, sometimes this is easier said than done, in comparison with running a simple blog. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blog, you only have to focus on writing. But, with an online business, there&#8217;s so much you have to consider in the content of your website. The difficulty comes in creating that balance of posting and promoting media about the products and services that your company offers. In addition to that, you need to incorporate the necessary keywords and content on your site. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s where the help of a digital marketing agency comes in handy. They know the best tricks in creating content that allows you to have a stronger foundation in establishing your brand authority. They know how to make customers trust you to the extent that they come to purchase your products instead of your competitor’s. </span>
<a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/41-content-types-you-should-employ-in-your-marketing-strategy-a9a3b171b10e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24589 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/content-marketing.jpeg" alt="content marketing" width="696" height="623" /></a>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Allows You To Focus On Other Priorities</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many responsibilities entailed when running an online business. Even when it&#8217;s still new, this doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not going to keep you busy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a small team, this means that every member might be doing too many tasks in a day. That way, you&#8217;re unable to focus on business priorities. In this situation, your business ceases to operate efficiently.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To take a load of marketing off your shoulders, leave it to the experts by hiring a digital marketing agency. When they&#8217;ve got this covered, you and your team can focus on other more critical tasks. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, your day-to-day operations become more efficient. As your team becomes more productive, the performance of your online business improves as well. </span>
<ol start="5">
 	<li>
<h2><b> It Strives To Boost Your ROI</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ROI (return on investment) refers to the time when your online business starts earning profits. By profits, this also means that whatever amount you shelled out as your initial capital has already been covered and paid for. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because you&#8217;re in the field of business, this is a significant quantitative factor for you to consider. You always need to have a faster ROI. That way, you&#8217;ll get to reap the benefits of what you have sowed, faster.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can better achieve this through a digital marketing agency. They’ll continuously study your movement and creates ways and changes to have a better ROI. The agency you&#8217;ll hire won&#8217;t stop working and testing various strategies to find the best one that works for you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact shows that despite the added cost that comes along with the hiring of a digital marketing agency, the benefits that you’re to gain are also higher.</span>
<ol start="6">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Gives You Access To The Latest Technology</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The job of a digital marketing agency is solely focused on marketing trends and techniques. Hence, you can expect them to be the authority in this field. More than anything else, they&#8217;re up-to-date with the latest technology that you can apply in your online business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When these technologies are offered for you to use, your online or web presence also improves. This also means better rankings.</span>
<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is not just a trend that&#8217;s in passing. It has proven to be very effective over the past years, and it’ll continue to be in many more years to come. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re running an online business, a bulk of your efforts should be placed in marketing. That way, you&#8217;re leading yourself towards achieving more of your business goals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, when you&#8217;ve got your hands full, often it&#8217;s hard to focus on studying what the latest trends are. This is where the benefits of a digital marketing agency come in.</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/how-can-your-online-business-benefit-from-a-digital-marketing-agency/">How Can Your Online Business Benefit From A Digital Marketing Agency?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4><b>Digiperform- Hi Riddhi Chhabria. Briefly share about yourself, your hobbies, likes or dislikes, previous experiences…..etc. in your words.</b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I’d like to thank you for giving us this opportunity. The entire team of All Stars Digital is thrilled and grateful. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with my professional life first, by the way, I&#8217;ve got a lot to say, so just loosen up and grab coffee…. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after I completed my Computer engineering from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai, I worked at Viacom18’s Voot in their brand management sector. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the time, everything was about branding, from the basic color-scheme, logo placement understanding to Brand Reputation and Visibility which intrigued me. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like marketing and more specifically Brand Management is my calling. That is when I decided to pursue my further studies in this line. I managed to receive an admit from New York University &#8211; School of Professional Studies for Masters in Integrated Marketing. Lucky Me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">From the very first day, I had concluded that I’ll specialize in Brand Management, but not everything goes as per planned. It felt like my life had some other plans.  </span>
<h4><em><strong>How did I start working?</strong></em></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My first internship in the USA was at </span><a href="https://www.newyorkminutemag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><i>New York Minute Magazine</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, my role was to monitor and optimize the analytics using all Social Media platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After which, I returned to India for my Summer break and worked at </span><a href="https://www.republicworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Republic TV </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for 4 months. I contributed towards their digital launch and solely oversaw their youtube page, here I learned the importance of monetization of social media platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of my past 3 experiences, I got my first job in the States. It started the moment I returned for my third semester. Tier One Advertising Agency (T1), I joined as a part-time Marketing Associate and after 6 months I was promoted to Operations Manager. Coordinating with all the clients, handling social media platforms, SEO (Website and App stores) were a few of my duties at T1. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was lucky to have had a chance of working directly with </span><b>Akon’s team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to launch his app </span><b>Emojikon</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and managing social media accounts of many models including a few </span><b>Victoria’s Secret Angels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emojikon.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-22400 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/emojikon.jpg" alt="emojikon" width="411" height="411" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I simultaneously freelanced for a few other companies and learned as much as I can about <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-guide-marketing-todays-digital-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Marketing</a>. My counselor at NYU was pleased with my work experience and said that I have earned extra credits and I qualify for a double specialization. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I graduated with a Master’s degree and a double specialization in Brand Management and Digital Marketing. After working at T1 for more than a year, my father Mr. Nagesh Chhabria recommended considering starting my own agency back in India. It was a great idea. Why not use my expertise in my own country. And, it clicked!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the support of my family I founded my agency, after interviewing more than 100 people, my ideal team was hired and now we proudly call ourselves </span><b>All Stars Digital</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>My Hobbies</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #993300;">:</span> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love traveling, I have visited 4/7 continents. Rest is on my travel list. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a Bollywood fan and I love reading books of thriller and fiction genre. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An absolute dog lover, my family is currently the home for 2 dogs namely Euro (Shih Tzu) and Yen (Labrador).</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Digiperform</b><b>&#8211; Please tell us about All-Stars Digital. Also, share the foundation of the company? How it got started?</b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly speaking,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to start my own Influencer marketing agency in Mumbai. I strongly believe that any influencer on Instagram with just a thousand followers; or a mega Bollywood star followed by millions have the power to influence an audience into buying any product/service. </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The catch is it needs the right push. And that’s where we come into the picture! </span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, I decided that we won’t just restrain to only influencer marketing but use every digital marketing service to influence the audience with their purchase decisions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All Stars Digital is the shine that adds sparks &amp; shimmer needed to generate buzz, attract and convert the audience from being a mere follower to a consumer, using everything the digital space has to offer.</span>
<a href="https://allstarsdigital.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-22401 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ASD-Logo.png" alt="all stars digital" width="370" height="188" /></a>
<h4><b>Digiperform</b><b> &#8211; You have shared the profiles of your team on your website. No doubt, you have an amazing team. Please tell something about your team? Also, we are very much interested to know more about your company’s mascot Euro? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After interviewing around 150-200 people I found my dream team. Though, some have discontinued working with us because they had to explore other opportunities, and I completely understand that. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them started his own company and returned as a client but all the others who stayed have been loyal and constantly working hard to achieve our goals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can say, I have been lucky to have a great team whether they have stayed with me or not. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a proud team, filled with millennials all wanting the same thing I do, find some quirk and show it in our work.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-22397 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Team.jpeg" alt="" width="591" height="669" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They all are working here because at the end of the day, everyone has to contribute with campaign ideas for each of the clients, whether they are in the Social media team, Marketing team, Search engine marketing, design team or are solely invested in content writing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each person at All Stars Digital wants to test their creative side and contribute and make our brands shine. With all the running around and the constant pressure to think out of the box, not all days are happy and easy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where Euro comes in the picture, our company’s mascot. I like to assume that he’s our stress buster, he visits us almost daily and showers everyone with love.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-22394 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Euro.jpeg" alt="Euro- Mascot" width="440" height="505" />
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Digiperform</b><b>&#8211; Knowing your high professional activity, how do you combine your agenda to fulfill the tasks as a marketer, consultant, and entrepreneur?</b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first misconception of starting a company, in any field, is that one can do what they like. More than doing it’s like monitoring, encouraging others to do it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, most part of my day goes in monitoring everyone’s work, building a rapport with every team member, trying my best to help them implement what I imagine. Phewww!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At times, they provide exactly what I am looking for and the rest of the times, they surpass my imagination. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an entrepreneur I have learned, I have to do a little of everything, from balancing between finance to surveying new hires like an HR, from monitoring all content to contributing with campaigns, and primarily dealing with people be it my team members or clients. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been lucky to have clients from different genres, our campaign meetings are undoubtedly the time we all look most forward to. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brainstorming ideas, listening to some really good concepts and understanding how different people with different backgrounds can come up with strategies to promote the same product is the best part of what I do. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when I feel like a marketer. I think, that 1 of my best decisions has been making it a compulsion for everyone to contribute to campaigns. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been blessed with opportunities in a way that I have had some experience in every field of digital marketing, in the start it was helpful for me and now I am in a position to share it with my friends, team members, and clients. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Till today people don’t understand which service of digital marketing is going to help them better reach their goals. Consulting people on how they should allocate their funds, and why a particular service fits best for them has been a norm of my entrepreneurial life. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consulting also includes a lot of strategies developing. We came across a client who hired us for 3 months only to consult her, give her strategies a direction, suggest her ways on how to grow and later she signed us for the implementation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think of myself as a marketer, wearing entrepreneurial shoes and paving the path as a consultant, always on the lookout to fill potholes with the rocks of progression. </span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Digiperform</b><b>&#8211; What makes All Stars Digital &#8211; the Best Digital Marketing Agency in Mumbai?</b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are an agency that looks at everything differently, gives solutions differently and makes marketing easier &#8211; Differently!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are an agency that provides quick and quirky digital marketing solutions that help brands shine. We are All Stars Digital. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever we do we do it with passion. Yes, there are many like us. But every employee has the same vigor and vision that I have. Be the one-stop solution for everything digital. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the digital space changing every nanosecond, it is difficult for brands to keep up with the digital hemisphere. We make sure that’s checked off for our brands. We are available, ready and game to anything digital.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This industry brings along a fair amount of challenges but it somehow drives all of us. We work for our brands and that’s why we work even harder when they bring different challenges on our plate.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Digiperform</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>How do you see digital marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?</b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of theories when it comes to the future of social media but in our opinion, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape is dynamic and unpredictable. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that social media is constantly evolving, which is what makes it a very exciting field to work in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is an industry that constantly keeps you on your toes and forces you to be creative. This helps us grow as individuals making us nurture our creative spark as well as move with the fast-growing, changing trends. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This industry cannot be confined to one part of the spectrum and is going to constantly evolve and grow.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Three Trends for the year 2019</b></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition is fierce and consumers are unpredictable, which makes you brainstorm new marketing ways to persuade people to buy your products and services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different methods such as engaging web content, PPC campaigns, blogs, social media and videos still common and popular among entrepreneurs, but these sources are not enough if you want to create competition in the market. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology trends are evolving as fast as anything and therefore you have to stay abreast of them. There are many digital marketing trends that will drastically change your digital business in 2019.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Voice search for higher CTR</b></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to experts, 3 billion searches made on Google every day are voice searches. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri have recently been introduced that identify human speech and answer queries. When you type a query in the search bar, you get lots of search results and therefore chances are the customer will lose sight of your website. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when a customer uses a natural-language user interface, for instance, Siri, it’ll give you a few results and therefore your CTR can be much higher if your website is amongst those results. So make your search phrases more conversational.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #993300;"><b>Chatbot for personalized customer services</b></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication with customers is now easier with chatbot while keeping a lid on your budget. It can be integrated with a website, social media and an application, and interactive agents can receive queries and give data related answers. You can use user queries and information to make a further customized marketing strategy.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #993300;"><b>Video marketing to grab more audience</b></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos are expected to continue to rise because the majority of customers watch videos than reading blogs. If you want to draw the attention of your customers to your new launch, make an engaging video detailing about the product and spread it on all social media platforms including your website. Find the best way to incorporate video marketing into your strategy.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #993300;"><b>Programmatic Advertising</b></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Programmatic advertising involves the use of automation technology to buy and sell digital media. Its benefits far outweigh traditional advertising benefits. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The automation can help you buy advertising space more efficiently and target advertisers’ most valuable customers. You can access any amount of your audience, analyze data and get a real picture of how effective your ad is, which will further help you develop a more effective ad campaign.</span>

&nbsp;
<h4><b>Digiperform</b><b>&#8211; According to you, what are the various ingredients for a successful digital marketer and business?</b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingredients, if looking, are very simple and basic. They apply to every company or institution. </span>
<b>Knowledge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Knowing what you&#8217;re doing </span>
<b>Skills/Tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In this day and age it&#8217;s very important to have the right tools and skills to make things work out for yourself and your client.</span>
<b>Will</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: All my employees have one common goal and that pushes their will to put everything aside and keep the clients happy. Focus and will trickle down like a grapevine. It begins from the top management.   </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, </span><b>Creativity</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many of us out there. What makes us stand out is the creativity. We make sure that our content is different, engaging and digitally viable for the audiences. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least</span>
<b>Keeping it simple: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be straight to your audience and your clients. There&#8217;s a paradigm shift. We see it amongst us as well. The consumer is smarter than ever. They know what&#8217;s happening. It&#8217;s always better to be straightforward then be called flakey!</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Digiperform</b><b>&#8211; Any suggestion you would like to give to our readers and students?</b></h4>
<b>Riddhi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my experience, it’s not necessary that you make your career in the same field you did your education in. Your Skill plays a major role in your career than a degree.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the motto of Digiperform too, <strong>#SKILLOVERDEGREE</strong></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an engineer, I dreamt of securing a job in one of the big tech companies. While working for college fests and extracurricular activities, I found myself invested in marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While working at Viacom18, I wanted a career in brand management, but I kept getting jobs in different sectors of digital marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I’m here running an agency where digital marketing is the least of my worries and everything else that comes in with running a company like finance, sales, hiring and managing people, understanding the clients’ needs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m confident a year from now I’ll be heading towards different, learning something new. And that’s the best motivator. Knowing that you’re walking towards progression. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone wants a job to either make money or to gain experience to get something better, but the people who try out new lines or working to learn more, to be better and with the urge to progress are the true winners. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s world, it is of utmost importance to be a jack of all trades, else you’ll lag and watch everyone overtake you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And All Stars Digital is a growing company, we are always looking for new, talented and efficient youngsters, feel free to drop in your CVs at </span><b>info@allstarsdigital.in</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile marketing is one of the most popular methods of marketing of this millennium; all because of its wide reachability and efficiency. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In India, where more than 370 million of the population is using smartphones, it makes easier for businesses to use a wide range of targetting through <a href="https://digiperform.com/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital marketing strategies</a>. </span>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“One day, Mobile marketing would win over all the methods of online marketing.”</strong> </span></em>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was well forecasted by one of the growing digital entrepreneurs who believed that for businesses, mobile would become the ideal source to stay connected with their customers all the time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">From mobile check-ins to messages, emails to social media platforms, mobile would become another member of the family. Therefore, businesses, in turn, would need the right mobile marketing strategy to make most of it.  </span>

It is recognized as one of the world’s leading digital marketing, web, and mobile app development and marketing company.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Chit Chat Session:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Digiperform is all planning to spread its wing in the Tamil Nadu, we thought to get in touch with him, side by side and asked few questions about his professional experiences. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this chit-chat session, he shared about his early experiences, how his company Dot Com Infoway came to play and how he keeps himself updated with the latest marketing trends. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go! </span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>What Dot Com Infoway is all about? Please share the goal and objective of your company. What makes it different?</b></h4>
<a href="https://www.dotcominfoway.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dot Com Infoway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an award-winning, end-to-end IT and mobile solutions company. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Established in the year 2000, Dot Com Infoway has come a far way from being a pure web solutions company to its present stage where we offer myriad services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The services include IT outsourcing, web and mobile application development, mobile marketing, digital marketing and IT infrastructure support services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During its course of evolution, Dot Com Infoway has won several excellence awards and complies with the highest benchmarks in project, quality, and operations. </span>

<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-19170 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-30-at-11.03.41-PM.png" alt="" width="385" height="242" />
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Please share your journey so far? What are the major challenges you face as Director of the company?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Dot Com Infoway has witnessed several changes in technology and market trends. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our company’s vision is to be an early adopter of new technology and emerging market trends, which has helped us ride all significant technological changes with comparative ease. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our journey so far has been quite rewarding as we have developed impeccable solutions and garnered loyal clients.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Director of Dot Com Infoway, I have faced many challenges, and I am thankful for that. For me, challenges are opportunities in disguise. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been my nature to innovate on the go, and that has kept the company going on for nearly two decades now. Challenges occur cyclically. Only those who commit to keeping moving forward face challenges.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>According to you, what role mobile marketing play in the market? Why should companies follow a mobile marketing strategy?</b></h4>
<a href="https://www.dotcominfoway.com/mobile-application-development/mobile-apps-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plays a significant role in the market today. With over 5 billion people using smartphones around the world, almost half the world is browsing products and services on their phones. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies have realized the power of mobile marketing and have adopted the mobile-first approach. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With mobile phones becoming the first source for people to check-out products they want to buy and the services they wish to hire, marketing using the mobile platform is a logical choice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen the dynamics of online marketing and advertising changing to focus on mobile phone-oriented advertising campaigns. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a lot of new technologies have emerged in the past ten years, which is helping developers create mobile apps that are swifter, smarter and effective for users.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses must have a comprehensive <a href="https://digiperform.com/role-mobile-marketing-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile marketing strategy</a> in place to reach out their target audience with impact. Today, there are millions of mobile apps and shopping platforms; to find the target customer at the right platform and at the right time is quintessential.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>How do you see Digital Marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?</b></h4>
<a href="https://www.dotcominfoway.com/internet-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is well-poised to see a continual growth next year. With mobile phones as the leading interface, the digital marketing industry will keep growing in leaps and bounds. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that AI and Machine Learning would drive most successful digital marketing campaigns in 2019 as newer, much powerful marketing tools will evolve.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, videos would remain one of the most successful marketing mediums in 2019. Much shorter videos with crisp, compelling content will rule the roost. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdly, the role of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in digital marketing will enhance. We have barely scratched the surface, and there is still a lot for marketers to benefit from these technologies to promote products and solutions in a more engaging way.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>What are your future goals in this marketing industry?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dot Com Infoway is one of the top-ranking digital marketing companies in the world and has won several awards in this domain. We aim to retain our top position in the industry by augmenting our services and client base. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We plan to keep offering our clients a good mix of business strategy, great content and cutting-edge technology, neatly wrapped in digital marketing campaigns.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Why do you think it’s important for everyone to understand the importance of Digital Marketing today?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has evolved significantly in the last two decades, and billions of people spend hours each day on the internet across devices. Digital marketing enables marketers to leverage this wide adoption of the internet to reach out to their target audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not just for brands selling products and services, digital marketing today is helping social and environmental causes by making a direct plea to a multitude of people at one go. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, as the technology evolves further and AI, Machine Learning and AR/VR become an integral part of digital marketing, businesses would have the opportunity to engage directly with each customer throughout the purchase decision.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>How do you stay updated on the latest trends in Digital Marketing? Which are the Digital Marketing resources (i.e. blogs/websites/apps) you visit regularly?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I read a lot of blogs and trending updates by influencers and leading bloggers and online publications such as The Moz Blog, <a href="https://digiperform.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digiperform Blog</a>, Content Marketing Institute, SEJ, HubSpot Blog and <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogs by Neil Patel</a>.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Any suggestion you would like to give to our readers and students?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To the readers and students, I have just one message; have faith in the technology. If your intent and association with all the incredible technology that we have today, you have the power to make the world a much better place.</span>
