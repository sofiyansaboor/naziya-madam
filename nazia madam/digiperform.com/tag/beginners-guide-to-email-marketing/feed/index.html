<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever we talk about Automation, the first picture came in our mind is robots, machines, etc. In other words, pretty much opposite to human. </span>
<h2><b>So, what is Email Marketing Automation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of email marketing, automation is the ability to send and reply to emails automatically.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a> is the ability to send or reply triggered emails to subscribers with relevant information as per your email campaign. It can be used for the variety of marketing campaigns, for example, welcome emails, End Of Season emails, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.freshworks.com/marketing-automation/email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Email Marketing</a> technology helps to nurture more leads and add a personal touch by sending birthday greetings on time, or automated blog updates, etc. Email automation helps to make your email marketing campaign more personalized and efficient in every way.</span>
<h2><b>How Does Email Marketing Automation Work?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email Marketing Automation can help marketers as well as businessmen to create email workflows that automatically emails to subscribers once a certain trigger has been activated. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of triggers for a <strong>B2B</strong> company are …</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a website visitor views a landing page but doesn’t submit the form</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a lead has downloaded several pieces of content but has not contacted the business directly</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a potential client has started following the company’s social media accounts</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a <strong>B2C</strong> brand, triggers might be …</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a website visitor has viewed several items but not added any to their cart</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a consumer has placed items in their shopping cart but not purchased</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a consumer makes a purchase</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing automation just not only for prospective customers, but it can also help brands to retain their old customers as well. You can share new product launches as well as reminders emails to your existing as well as new prospects through the automated email marketing campaign. </span>

<strong>There also are a few workflows that work well for both B2B and B2C businesses. Here are some examples:</strong>
<h2><b>Automated Welcome Emails: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever a new customer or subscriber joins your newsletter or visits your website, you can send welcome emails through automated email campaigns welcoming your clients and stating about the company as well as services. It gives a great impression when you send beautiful emails just after subscribers show interest in your brand. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/target-welcome-email.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-18115 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/target-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" width="372" height="521" /></a>
<h2><b>Feedback Request Emails: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With an automated email marketing campaign, you can send feedback emails asking for the product feedback they have recently used, the working of the new app, how was the shopping experience and more. The feedback request email can be both positive as well as negative based on the kind of feedback you ask.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.31.08-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18189 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.31.08-PM.png" alt="" width="440" height="461" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While your messaging will be different depending on which behavior triggered the feedback request, these emails are extremely valuable as they show your subscribers you care about your opinion and also give you the chance to see where you can improve.</span>
<h2><b>Re-engagement Emails:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of emails help to reconnect with your existing clients or subscribers who haven’t shown any interest in some days. You can reschedule your emails (let’s say 90 days) to send your emails stating new discounts, the launch of products or blog updates etc to maintain the relationship with your prospects.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/discount-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18194 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/discount-1.png" alt="" width="410" height="457" /></a>
<h2><b>Thank you Emails:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending an order confirmation and shipping information is a must when someone has completed a purchase. Adding a thank you message to a fulfillment email is a great way to improve your customer experience and build a good impression. They are also a smart way to combat any potential buyer’s remorse, reassuring customers they made a wise choice.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.33.21-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18191 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.33.21-PM.png" alt="" width="365" height="402" /></a>
<h2><b>Sale Countdown Emails: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sale countdowns are the perfect email automation to create a sense of anticipation or urgency around your sale. You could count down to when the sale begins. Or, once the sale is on, count down the hours, minutes, and seconds left until customers miss out. Countdown timers are a visually engaging element to add to these emails that are sure to grab your customer’s attention.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.35.55-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18192 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.35.55-PM.png" alt="" width="611" height="439" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost any action an individual takes when engaging with your brand can be tracked and utilized.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Why Should a marketer Use Email Marketing Automation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are five primary reasons every email marketer should use email marketing automation:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create highly segmented email lists that are automatically updated based on user data</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More quickly convert potential customers into actual customers</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More easily continue engaging with potential and existing customers</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Increase efficiency by automating the repetitive tasks associated with customer relationship management</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Improve engagement by delivering subscribers more relevant, personalized and timely messages</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some brands hesitate to use an automated form of an email campaign as they believe to give a personal touch to each and every email. Or, they may lack knowledge about automation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reality, automation makes it easier for you to keep track of your customers&#8217; activity. It gives more personalization to your email marketing campaigns and it&#8217;s more effective for the long run as well.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Why is an automated email marketing campaign important for any business?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some great pointers for automating your email campaigns:</span>
<h2><b>Show personal care to your audience</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best point of email marketing automation is that it gives the 24X7 advantage to stay in touch with your clients without any burden of manpower. As per campaign protocol, you can send relevant emails/replies on time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a subscriber has just joined for free services to have a free trial test of your product. With your regular updates and assistance, your same free subscriber can turn into paying customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Same in the case of e-commerce, if one has landed upon your website and joined your email newsletter. Your regular updates regarding sales or discounts can turn the same customer into paying one. As the sales and discounted emails will interest him/her and lead to purchase any item as well. </span>
<h2><b>Save Time</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t like to save time? When it comes to business emails, it&#8217;s not easy to update or rewrite each email and send it to the subscriber. if you feel like to do so, you may need the hell of manpower to complete just messages and replies. Automation helps to save your time in this case. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than wasting time replying to each mail, it&#8217;s important to utilize the same time to design content for your upcoming email campaign or creating more email marketing strategies for your business. After you build the automation it unfolds by itself and you can spend your time on other things. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is monitor your campaigns time after time, analyze reports and review the emails that are not bringing the desired results. Don’t forget to optimize your campaigns by A/B testing.</span>
<h2><b>Grow Your Revenue Faster</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you plan your email marketing strategy with automation, you can expect tremendous results in terms of revenue as well. Because when you will be seriously sending emails to your customers/subscribers, there will be high chances to increase your click as well as open rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By tracking your click-open through rates and other actions, marketers can analyze which are the most interesting campaigns so far and how much they have generated leads or sales. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquiring a new lead is more expensive than generating on your own. Also, with automation, you can encourage your existing customers to shop more. It is no surprise that most marketers are interested in upselling. This will get easier to do with a behavior-based automation series (history) which will suggest your existing, as well as new customers, buy more products.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you may have seen how big e-commerce companies like eBay and Amazon are doing this by sending you similar products to the ones you already purchased. This is a great example of automation that is determined by the customer’s purchase history.</span>
<h2><b>Organize Your Campaigns</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal way to start any content-centric campaign is by creating an email marketing calendar. With the organized calendar, you will be more sorted and can look your campaign at a bigger picture. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation is a great help for any planning enthusiast because it lets you stick to the plan even when you are busy doing other things. Just prepare and schedule the content and the campaign will work itself out.</span>
<h2><b>Maintain Brand Personality</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing helps in maintaining the channel of communication between the brand and its customers. With automation, these possibilities increase ten folds. Automation helps to draft better emails and act as a voice for your brand. It conveys a better message to the prospects and reinforces the brands’ values. </span>
<h2><b>Measure Your Email Marketing Campaigns’ Results</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a general email marketing campaign, automation also helps to have an overview of how many emails are opened? Which emails generated more leads? Which parts of the campaign can be improved through A/B testing? Etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing tools allow you to monitor who is opening what, how many emails are bounced, and track all email activity for Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have integrated your campaign with Google Analytics, you can analyze your data and see automatically where the leads come from, how they converted, etc.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your email marketing campaign analytics can teach you about your subscribers’ behavior by showing the content they are most interested in. In other words, analytics let you evaluate what content attracts people to your products or services, which converts them to leads, and what convinces them to buy. Evaluate your marketing performance, adjust your future initiatives and reach your goals in a more cost-effective and time-saving way!</span>

 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, what are the w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ays to grow an email marketing list?</span></li>
</ul>
Here we go!
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What is the </b><strong>Email Marketing List?</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An email marketing list is a list of subscribers/customers who are a part of periodic mailing distribution by the businesses. The email marketing list generally includes each person&#8217;s email address rather than a postal address. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the experts, it is always a good idea to include as much information with the mailing list as possible; like that:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps in tracking which services/products are used or purchased by that customer.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track how they make purchases.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, track how often they contact customer service.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Why are contacts and lists important?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For any business, the email is always taken as the trustable source to interact with customers. With the prevalence of social media and hundreds of other messaging services, the emails are considered as the most appropriate way to communicate and share business with the customers as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, having an accurate and responsive email marketing list of current customers is always a goldmine for any business. More importantly, having an updated and test mailing list can be an ultimate reason for any successful marketing campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These lists play a big role in any marketing strategy as they provide leads for sales, a group for testing new products and a group to provide feedback on satisfaction.</span>
Still not sure, read out astonishing <a href="https://digiperform.com/31-astonishing-email-marketing-statistics-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing statistics</a> that you need to know&#8230;&#8230;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What is the role of the email marketing list in online business?</b></span></h2>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>More People Will Read Your Messages</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt, people are active on social media than any other platform. However, there are many ways that add lots of worry surroundings on the use of social media. The readers don’t accept every social media post to be read and followed. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, from a marketer perspective, the social media platforms’ algorithms keep on changing which makes it sometimes not easy to share descriptive information. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These algorithm limits won’t let you drop your message directly in your customer&#8217;s inbox. The emails help to deliver your content straight to your subscribers’ inbox and urge them to read at their leisure. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore no worry about the algorithms and limited access, you can directly send your product details to your subscriber&#8217;s inbox and increase the traffic simultaneously.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fab-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17541 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fab-1.png" alt="" width="452" height="553" /></a>
<h4><b>Share the Launch of New Products</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you gain trusted readers from your email marketing list, you can share various information related to your businesses; like product launches, posts related to new products and much more. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your current subscribers who are happy to read your email will definitely invest his/her time to read about your new product launches and show the interest to try your new product as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can even utilize your designated email marketing list to create the curiosity among readers before the product launch as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, sharing the complete information about new events on time and getting the people to talk about your product/business (which is the ideal motto of any mailing list). It’s a great way to get ideas for new products that will do well in the market. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This element is generally beneficial in the case of e-commerce. For Example, you might have noticed in your inboxes that e-commerce companies keep on sharing their upcoming sales and new seasonal product launches to keep their customers ready and alert enough to make most out of the sale.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see the example in the picture as well. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17539 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email2.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="759" /></a>
<h4><b>To Generate Sales Leads</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have built the required trust, shared enough information with your subscribers and people who have already purchased from your company are more likely to purchase again provided have given a good experience.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An email marketing list gathered from your subscribers is a great way to start your sales strategy; particularly if you are a company with multiple SKUs or products. As I have mentioned earlier, mailing list plays a big role in the case of e-commerce companies or companies with multiple product choices. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a company that leases vehicles and provides roadside services can contact their customers who have only purchased one or the other. The sales team can try to persuade their customers to purchase the other service through the right content and email marketing list. </span>
<h4><b>Customer Service</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A great email marketing list can also build by providing good customer service. Also, the list can be effectively used to get feedback on satisfying levels. Giant companies use call center applications like Optimum and ask customers to complete a survey on their experience.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17542 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email3.png" alt="" width="657" height="434" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The email marketing list can be utilized to find the areas of your company and work on to bring low to high satisfaction levels. Learn from your customers and let them help you improve.</span>
<h4><b>Return On Investment</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you still not believe what wonders an email marketing list could do and how it can be more powerful than social media, then you need to focus on these three words: <em><strong>Return On Investment</strong></em>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you do to bring the best out of your marketing campaigns; all will go in vain if it&#8217;s not generating conversions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the conversion can be in many forms like clicks, reviews, purchase, download etc, depending on your call-to-action buttons. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of various email marketing tools like <a href="http://www.aweber.com/easy-email.htm?id=479814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWeber</a>, <a href="http://www.getresponse.com/index/aditi0308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetResponse</a>, <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MailChimp</a>, <a href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/29912177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConvertKit</a>, <a href="http://www.benchmarkemail.com/?p=777762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benchmark</a>, etc, you can keep a track on your conversions and build your upcoming campaigns on the basis of the tool analysis.</span>

<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Best Practices to Build an Email Marketing List (Step by Step Guide on how to start building your </b><strong>Email Marketing List</strong><b>)</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is even said by many marketers that the secret of a great campaigns lies in a great email marketing List. However, you need patience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can not start sending emails to your subscribers and expect conversions in just minutes. You need to create a right email marketing campaign.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An ideal marketer will always start the best campaign with the best email marketing lists, understand its reader&#8217;s interest and create a brilliant design with engaging copies including graphics. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should have three main priorities for building a quality list. In order, these are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Quality-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You want real information from real people who check their email frequently.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Relevance-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These people should be genuinely interested in your brand and industry.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Volume-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the first two priorities are squared away, you can start focusing on quantity.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Step 1: Start Early As You Can </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An ideal marketer will understand the importance of <a href="https://digiperform.com/what-is-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email marketing</a>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One should start looking for various email marketing tools and read various case studies to understand how big companies make their name in this competitive world through email marketing campaigns. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right strategy and tools, your email list will be able to compound the growth that you deserve and the time you spend developing it. Sooner you start, faster you will be able to build the email marketing list and longer it will help. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with the basic and simple segments, crafting email campaigns that target the specific groups of your email subscribers basis on their interest. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, divide your list into 2 segments: </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">1) customers who have already made a purchase from your company, and </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2) prospects who have expressed interest in your company. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">AND;</span>

<b>Start With Who You Know</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just start with the current email marketing list you have. If you have nil, then import all of your existing customers&#8217; contacts you have in your CRM system which would give you a decent start. You can also dig the list of your previous email list from old campaigns. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For building your email list, you can use one of the many email marketing services available. Some that we recommend are MailChimp, AWeber, and Infusionsoft.</span>
<h4><b>Step 2: Build a Great Content</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What would you share in your email campaigns? The content, right! Before using your email marketing list, you should be sure enough that you have paralleled content to be shared. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare your content strategy, try to use more graphics, fewer links, advised information, and attractable but non-offensive content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should only think to serve and direct your customers/subscribers into your website as well as an incentive to subscribe (so that they can receive the exclusive content/emails in future).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do understand creating an ideal content takes times. You should have enough resources who can create content strategies for you or you can try yourself as well. Once you have done with the content, add graphics and videos if you can. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not forget to add </span><b>Call-to-Actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the email subscription or your call out action like download, signup, purchase, call back, etc.</span>

<h4><b>Step 3: Analyze Your Email Marketing List</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of your email marketing tools, you can analyze that the email marketing list is worthy enough to give you the desired conversion. Are the emails going spam? What are the opening rates? These minor details will not only help you to build an ideal email marketing list but also gives you the chance to target the right customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note: Test and optimize your segmented email campaigns regularly.</strong> </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to opens, clicks, and conversions, be sure to measure success using such metrics as sales, return on investment, and overall revenue. Based on the results, adjust your email content and segments to continually improve your performance results.</span>

<h4><b>Step 4: Get Your People Sharing</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I won’t deny the fact that social sharing is also the most powerful and easiest way to get more followers/subscribers. For example, adding a “<strong>SHARE</strong>” feature on the body of the email content and social media pages links in the bottom of each mailer can increase the click-through rates by 158 percent which is huge as per marketing experts. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, sharing isn’t just about getting more email subscribers to engage with your content, it’s also about getting more people interested in becoming subscribers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you have shared some coupon in your email content to discount to your customers. Few of your customers want to share the same content as well coupon in their contact lists.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17538 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email1.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="775" /></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be more convenient for them if they can easily share the same content through social media shareable buttons. It will give a natural inclination to join your list for future offers (assuming that you have a  new customer, to begin with).</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Segmentation: Why do we recommend to segment your email marketing list?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, we stated in one step, segmenting your email list is very important if you want to build a strong email marketing list. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in product sale business, you can segment your subscribers/customers into 2 segments: </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">1) customers who have already made a purchase from your company, and </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2) prospects who have expressed interest in your company. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent study, marketers have analyzed many email marketing tools and realized that segmentation impacts your email marketing performance results. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like,</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a study, MailChimp looked at the results of about 2,000 users who sent approximately 11,000 segmented campaigns to nearly 9 million recipients.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the segmented campaigns were compared to the results of the same customers’ unsegmented campaigns, which demonstrated that email list segmentation:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased opens by 14.31%</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased unique opens by 10.64%</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreased bounces by 4.65%</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased clicks by 100.95%</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreased unsubscribes by 9.37%.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And what about the impact of segmentation on email-marketing revenue? Compared to sending one-size-fits-all email campaigns, the Direct Marketing Association found that segmentation increased email campaign revenue by 760%.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is huge!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that is all for this chapter. We hope the chapter has given you an idea what is email marketing list is all about and how it can help you gain more customers (of course ROI) in the simplest ways. </span>
