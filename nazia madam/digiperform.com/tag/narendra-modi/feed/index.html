			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the sizzling personalities who has mesmerized the country through his perfect plans. From Digital India to Skill India, each mission has proved his only motto to help India to be recognized as one of the top developed countries in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of his mainstreaming programs &#8211; </span><b>Digital India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; has aimed at inclusive growth in areas of network connectivity, electronic services, products, manufacturing and job opportunities, etc. Even, the Government of India has embarked on an ambitious program to bridge India&#8217;s digital platform, connect thousands of villages to the Internet and create millions of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital India is the first step that is aimed at transforming the country into a digitally empowered society and a knowledge economy. With the enforcement of Digital India Initiative, India’s internet population has crossed over 465 million and our country has been experiencing rapid strides of progress with an evolving payments landscape, universal access to mobile connectivity, online Aadhar card-linking, Public Internet Access Programme, online ordering, digital jobs and many more internet innovations.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds7OgI5RcKA" width="820" height="344" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second step, </span><b>‘Skill India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ which is supposed to be a multi-skill programme that brings hope for the youth. This fulfills the real agenda to create opportunities, space, and scope for the development of the talents of the Indian youth and to develop more of those sectors which have already been put under skill development for the last so many years and also to identify new sectors for skill development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When Prime Minister Launches SKILL INDIA on the Occasion of World Youth Skills Day, 18,000 plus ITI graduating students received job offer letters on the occasion of World Youth Skills Day where Government sets the target to provide skill training to 40.02 crore people by 2022.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about Indian Economy, India is expected to emerge as one of the leading economies in the World and likely to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025 where the major impetus is being given to strengthening the backbone of our economy by the SME sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of SMEs which is estimated to be at 42.50 million (registered and non-registered together) which will employ about 106 million which is 40% of India’s total workforce. Comprehending the significance of the SME sector vis-a-vis lending numbers to the job market, contribution to GDP and fostering entrepreneurship and innovation, getting skilled under Skilled India Initiative can work as a wonder in all the parameters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the same advancements, the akin learning initiative can aim at bringing the huge gap that exists between the business’ digital skill needs and the availability of professionally trained fresh talents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Prime Minister has launched Nasscom&#8217;s platform &#8211; </span><b>FutureSkills</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; for skill development in eight varied technologies through Video Conference during the inaugural session of the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT)-2018, especially targeting to the youth of our country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, at Modi Ji addressed a State Level Youth Convention at Tumakuru, Karnataka, via video conference, on the theme – </span><b><i>Youth Power: A vision for New India</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He says, he tries his best to meet youth as much as possible, to understand their hopes and aspirations, and work accordingly. He completely believes in the fact that youth are the true pillars of Modern India &#8211; Developed India.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why PM Encourages youth for skill development?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the changing world scenario with regard to industry and the job market, there is now an overpowering need for skilled workers degrees. India is relatively young as a nation with around 28 million youth population being added every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 50 percent of its population is below the age of 25 and more than 65 percent are aged below 35. In 2017, The Indian Finance Minister presented his Budget Speech in the Parliament keeping youth engagement as a major working area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education and Skills Development continue to be a development priority and the Finance Ministry has amply provisioned for existing initiatives to be scaled up and newer initiatives to also be launched. The Budget 2017 brings in much more focus on Job creation and Skills Development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because our Govt believes that more we give importance to skill development, the more competent will be our youth as they are the active partners in nation’s development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15211 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-05-at-6.38.50-PM-300x107.png" alt="" width="751" height="268" /></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Digitalization, the Govt claims to skill and up-skill about two million technology professionals and skill another two million potential employees and students over the next few years. The platform offers skilling and upskilling are Digital Marketing (Internet of Things), Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual reality, robotic process automation, big data analytics, 3D printing, cloud computing and social and mobile. With the advent of new technologies, skilling of young professionals is critical.</span></p>
<p>Why is it important to get skills? How can you work to enhance your skills?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill-Based Jobs: About 90 percent of employment opportunities require skills. Only 20 percent of our graduates get employed. The rest are unable to get suitable employment due to the lack of employable skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the present context of globalization, the demand for skilled and multi-skilled workers has increased. This major factor has even encouraged top big companies to do something called <em><strong>Skilled Based Hiring</strong></em>.</span></p>
