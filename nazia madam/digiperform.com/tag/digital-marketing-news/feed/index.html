										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-guide-marketing-todays-digital-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Marketing</a> is a notable term that needs no introduction in today’s scenario. It allows you to market your products and services using digital technologies, mainly on the internet. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketing industry is evolving rapidly and with everyone moving fast-breaking things, it’s easy to fall behind on the news that really matters. Therefore, it’s our obligation to provide you with the latest marketing updates to keep you updated.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a look!</span>
<h2><b>Latest Digital Marketing Update 1:</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>From September 10, Twitter will going to limit your default number of Tweets, Retweets, Likes, Follows and Direct Messages</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17699 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/twitter_416x416.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="188" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter seems very serious about its commitment to improving the health of its platform. As going forward, Twitter will tighten the access to its API platform. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What does that mean? It means Twitter will restrict the number of your daily actions like the number of tweets, retweets, likes, follows and direct messages to avoid the messiness on the platform. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Twitter has announced that “<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2018/new-developer-requirements-to-protect-our-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all new requests to access the company’s API platform will be required to apply for a developer account</a>”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also restricting the default number of apps registered to a single account to 10 and limiting app-level rate limits for Tweets, Likes, Follows and Direct Messages.</span>
<h4><b>How do app developers can have new access?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, any developer who wants a new access to Twitter’s API platform (whether its standard or premium); the developers have to apply to go through a new developer account application process. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be a user-case review and policy compliance check, which will determine the approval. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the access will get denied if the app is used for purposes other than its original intent. And, Going through the API access application process is mandatory.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, any app developers who want to register on Twitter’s API platform for more than 10 apps will have to request special permission via Twitter’s API Policy support form. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this new change, the platform is also limiting the default number of apps a single developer account can have registered.</span>
<h4><b>What about existing apps and developers?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of existing app, they can still be managed through </span><a href="https://apps.twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>apps.Twitter.com</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform where an existing developer can access with their existing access to complete the developer account application to maintain their apps. The company will give at least a </span><b>90-days notice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to complete the review process. </span>
<h4><b>What are the limitations?</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter is limiting the number of Tweets and Retweets, Likes, Follows and Direct messages as follows:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tweets and Retweets (combined): 300 per three hours</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likes: 1,000 per 24 hours</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follows: 1,000 per 24 hours</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct messages: 15,000 per 24 hours</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Latest Digital Marketing Update 2:</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Snapshot has shuttered the doors for SNAPCASH </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17700 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/snapcash.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="209" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcash is a feature offered by Snapchat to allow users to send payments to other users via the app. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While this feature been only meant to focus on the user to user payments, the e-commerce geeks speculated that it would be the jump-off point for Snapchat to build out a broader e-commerce platform for brands.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s confirmed by the Snapchat that the feature would not be functioning after 30th August 2018. It was their first product created through a partnership with the company &#8211; </span><b>Square</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that had lasted 4 years. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2014, it allowed users to save their debit card information to the app to make it easy to transfer or send money to other users. They have also confirmed that pulling the plug on Snapcash would not allow the Snapchat to store users payment information within the app. </span>
<h2><b>Latest Digital Marketing Update 3:</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Facebook rolls out the new feature that will let multiple users watch and comment on Video at the same time. </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you have read right! Generally whenever we are watching a video, either we can watch it or comment on it. We can not do both the things at the same time. Don’t believe us, try it.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has confirmed over the <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/watch-party-launches-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> that they are testing a tool that would let multiple users watch and comment on the same video in Facebook Groups simultaneously.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-17701 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/facebook-watch-party.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="397" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tool (</span><b>Watch Party</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is currently in the testing phase and is in use by a small group of beta users. The company is even testing its ability even outside the groups as well as pages. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature will be quite beneficial for marketers as well as influencers where they can use the functionality to connect and engage with multiple customers at once. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the live videos, where users can only do one-way communication (either talking or reading the comments); this feature will capitalize on the group’s ability to communicate with one another and the hosts. And, these videos can be live and recorded. </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Product Manager Erin Connolly said in her post that “We’ve been focused on building new ways to bring people together around video, create connections, and ignite conversations; Watch Party is the next step in bringing this vision to life,”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, it has come up with two features; </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-hosting that allows multiple people to add videos to a Watch Party</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowdsourcing to enable anyone in a Watch Party to suggest videos for the host to add.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch comes with two new features: co-hosting that allows multiple people to add videos to a Watch Party, and crowdsourcing to enable anyone in a Watch Party to suggest videos for the host to add.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The test has shown the great results where there are even groups that dedicated more than 10 hours to a single Watch Party, with different members coming in and out throughout the day. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s all for this week. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our online platforms keep on evolving for better user experience.

This is a very innovative update by the Facebook sister company to make the content on the app more interactive and realistic.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This update may seem like a Poll update where users used to post polls with multiple choice answers. However, with this feature, users can have the option to ask the questions through an open window (stories) and followers/users also have the option to answer the same question in a response to a story or send a direct message as well. </span>
<b>Note: The update is available for both personal as well as business Instagram profiles.</b>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The human behavior is changing day by day so as the requirements. We always look for something new to add on in our day to day life. For same sake, it’s fair to say that <a href="https://digiperform.com/33-most-effective-social-media-marketing-tools-for-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social media platforms</a> are forever changing and keeping us on our toes. We would be lying if we say that there hasn’t been a time in the year that we find new every day where we have been feeling like we are playing to catch up with the changes. Recently Instagram has stolen the notable focus by introducing the new change in Instagram stories i.e. </span><b>Instagram Focus Portrait Mode.</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-15901 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/instagram-redesign-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The social media stories have a special place in our heart as it helps us to share our each “special or not so special moments”. It takes us away from our carefully-curated feeds and encouraging us to be more ‘of the moment’ with our posts. Over 300 million people are now using Instagram Stories every day and our dedication towards it keep Instagram introducing new updates as well.</span>
<b>Update:</b>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qoSJjXsOJFw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram announced the launch of a new &#8220;</span><b>Focus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; mode on 11 April-18 which is designed to allow Instagram users to take portrait images/create bokeh images with a softly blurred background. Bokeh represents an aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image produced by a lens. The feature is available as a new option next to &#8220;Superzoom&#8221; when you open up the camera. It can be used with the front or rear-facing cameras. Instagram says &#8211; while using Focus Mode &#8211; as soon as someone is in the shot, the person will stay in focus while the background becomes blurred. This is the special feature of Focus mode that it only works with a person in the frame which is quite appreciated by selfie lovers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus point of this mode is that it can be used with either photos or videos. It&#8217;s designed to be similar to the Portrait Mode feature available on Apple&#8217;s newer dual-lens devices. While Portrait Mode is a hardware-based feature has been generally available only iPhone series like iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X, whereas Instagram&#8217;s Focus mode is designed as a software-based feature, making it available on a wider range of devices. For this update, you need to update the latest version of Instagram to have focussed images. Whoila!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15899 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/insta1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="408" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s a Snapchat or Instagram, the stories are the most successful feature. Although the similarities to Snapchat are undeniable, it definitely paid off, raising the heat in competition between the companies. It has caused many Snapchat fans jump the ship and join Instagram which led Instagram user numbers to soar in 2017. By looking stats, Instagram Stories had 250 million daily users by August 2017 as compared to Snapchat’s 166 million. Meanwhile, Instagram has been evolving and lets us see stories on Desktop as well by November, which shows just how much of an integral feature Instagram views it to be. Another feature becomes possible by December that user can possibly feature ‘Story Highlights’ on our profile, allowing us to showcase our most popular or important Story posts beyond the 24-hour limit.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the same pace, Instagram will be introducing more happening features with an agenda to shift users to a more personal and immediate type of post that you find in the traditional feed. Instagram is heading in the direction of a more collaborative kind of social interaction on the platform by introducing &#8211; the Story polls.</span>
&nbsp;
<b>Other New Update:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram is also rolling out mention sticker on iOS, making it easier to for users to connect with their friends via Insta Stories. After the image is clicked from the stories camera, a user may open the sticker’s tray, tap the @mention sticker, and start typing the name of the account to be mentioned. This can then be rotated, scaled and placed wherever required.links. The company is also likely to be working on introducing video calls to the platform.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Youtube is one of the popular video sharing platforms all over the world with more than 1,300,000,000 viewers searching for videos daily. Not only for entertainment, it is used for business purposes as well; which makes it the second largest search engine next to Google. While searching or watching videos, you must have come across various skippable or unskippable ads at the beginning of every video (unless you have installed or added Ad-Blocker in your search engine extension). These skippable ads are generally termed as </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>TrueView Ads</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in YouTube world or advertising language.</span>
<b><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15643 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/YouTube-Skippable-Ad-300x158.png" alt="" width="721" height="380" /></b>
<b>The Update: </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube has combined their six-second bumper ads in stream format with CPM buying where users can skip them after five seconds. CPM which stands for &#8211; Cost per Thousand Impressions, is the amount an advertiser pays to have its ads served against videos 1000 times. Each time an ad on a video runs completely, its called an impression. </span><b>YouTube announced that brands can now buy its TrueView ads and optimize them for reach.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They have introduced a new skippable option for short-form branding ads called TrueView for Reach. </span>
<b><i>Key Points:</i></b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertisers pay for TrueView in-stream ads after viewers watch 30 seconds, the video ends or viewers interact with the ads. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads can run anywhere from six to under 30 seconds. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ads are then optimized for efficient reach.</span></li>
</ul>
<b><i>Still wondering what’s it all about? Let&#8217;s dig deep into this:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueView ads, commonly known as </span><b><i>bumper ads</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a short format of YouTube video ad that provides the viewer&#8217;s options &#8211; the ability to skip the advertisement just after five seconds. The bumper ads are designed in the format to allow ads to reach more customers with a motive to increase awareness about the brand by using short and memorable message. This means brands can create ads as short as six seconds (and up to 30 seconds), which users can skip after five seconds, and which will run before or during videos.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-FBiSOXGV4g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are four types of TrueView ads:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b><i>In-stream ads</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the viewers can skip the pre-roll ads just after five seconds. The Sponsors are supposed to pay only for ads that are entirely viewed or until 30 seconds have elapsed. The type of ads is suitable for short or long video content. </span></li>
 	<li><b><i>In-slate ads</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the sponsor pay for the ads that are selected by the viewers based on their interest and behavior. It allows viewers to among several sponsors&#8217; ads or opt for commercial breaks interspersed through the video content. The type of ads is suitable for videos that are at least 10 minutes long. </span></li>
 	<li><b><i>In-search ads</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ads are appeared in YouTube search results based on viewers keyword search or when the viewer&#8217;s search is related to the ad&#8217;s keywords. Sponsors pay for ads when the viewer begins to watch. </span></li>
 	<li><b><i>In-display ads</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ads are displayed in legacy formats that means they appear in the YouTube promoted videos overlay, in video suggestions and related videos, and in Google&#8217;s Click-to-Play format.  Sponsors are charged when viewers opt to watch an ad. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Google (the owners of YouTube), eight out of ten viewers prefer TrueView to other in-stream video ad formats. The TrueView Ads helps companies to maintain the interest of viewers as well advisors where the viewers can skip ads or select the ads they want to watch, the advertiser saves money and reaches a more targeted audience. </span>
<b><i>Continuation to update………</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube confirmed that with shifting it&#8217;s existing in stream format with the CPM buying, already ads are falling under the 95 percent viewable and 95 percent audible parameters. In this, advertisers only need to pay when a viewer watches the ad video at least 30 seconds or through the end of the video when they take actions like clicking on the call to action or other elements within the creative. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A YouTube spokesperson explained, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With TrueView for Reach, we’re responding to customers’ requests for ways to optimize their TrueView buys based on different campaign objectives. We now have three options, based on the scenarios our customers request most often: TrueView for Views (standard), TrueView for Action and TrueView for Reach. In all cases, ads can be skipped by the user after 5 seconds.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube states with the same advancements, they have paved the way for shorter branding ads of its unskippable six-second bumper ads that have been quite popular among advertisers since inception. Google says a 2017 global study showed bumper ads drove an average Ad Recall of more than 20 percent. Now, advertisers with those six-second assets can opt to run them as bumper ads or as TrueView for reach ads.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The study has stated that people are three times more likely to pay attention to online videos as compared to TV commercials. The online video ads were measured and generalized across the major platforms such as YouTube, Hulu, Facebook, Snapchat and full-episode players like NBC.com.</span>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat is one of the trendy apps launched in 2011, especially famous among the young population to communicate and share their current moments using snaps more than written text. It’s a photo messaging app that let users send images and videos that disappear after a set amount of time (24 hrs) for the audience or Snapchat users. Ideally, users can send snaps to multiple friends at once or add them to their Stories (Snaps), a feed of the images they have recently posted that can be watched by anyone who follows them. Anyone can also send private messages, and make voice and video calls.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15535 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bollywood-Celebrity-Snapchat-Usernames-Sonakshi-Sinha-AsliSonaSnap-169x300.png" alt="" width="265" height="470" /></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, in an ad commercial, Snapchat claimed itself as a </span><b>New Kind of Camera</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sabotaging the existence of other photo messaging apps such as Instagram, Vero etc. Snapchat always has an awareness issue and with such a non-existence figurine especially not among above 25-years generation slot, Snapchat is running its first TV campaign during the Final Four on TBS -American basic cable and satellite television channel and Youtube. The “</span><b>60-second spot &#8211; A New Kind of Camera</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” aims to explain Snap’s mission to be a “camera” company and is more educational than it is entertaining. The ad was created internally and the full 60-second and a 30-second version running on TV in prime-time, cable and syndication slots for the next two months.</span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat is famous for running clever, usually regional, out-of-home ads and campaigns in the past, but this campaign marks one of the company’s first earnest advertising efforts. It has launched a broader digital campaign, including digital versions of the ad and the website whatis.snapchat.com to educate consumers about the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat has also stated a few stats about the app to pitch the worth of the app to its customers like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average Snapchatter spends 30 minutes with the app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 3.5 billion pieces of content are created every day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the average user creates 20 pieces of content daily, per Snap’s own data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2017, Snapchat had about 187 million daily active users.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign comes at a critical time for Snapchat where CEO Evan Spiegel’s focus for the past 18 months is in positioning Snapchat as a camera company, has begun manufacturing and selling video-recording Spectacles since Snapchat created the Snap Inc. corporate name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> During the conference in February, Spiegel said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Snap really, very early on I think, began capitalizing on this idea that not only are cameras software but they are connected to each other.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This states that you can use the Snapchat camera for multiple purposes like for talking, learning about the world, storytelling, etc rather than just clicking pictures. With the evolution of cameras, Snapchat is definitely going to be the next generation Camera.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike most social networking platforms, the app&#8217;s messaging services are entirely mobile-based. if you are considering using Snapchat for your online marketing purpose, your smartphone can become a crucial marketing tool. As I have mentioned earlier that Snapchat is widely used among millennials, therefore, consider your target audience before committing to the platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Snapchat features that one should know:</b></p>
<p><b>Shoot 60 Second Snaps:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is quite a common and well aware feature where Android and iOS users can record up to 60 seconds of Snapchat footage (snaps) with Multi-Snap. Previously the Snapchat limit was only 10 seconds moved to 60 seconds on demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The procedure is very simple, all you need to do is tap and hold the center-circular Record button, and keep holding it for up to 60 seconds. Snapchat will split the footage into 10-second segments, which you can edit individually, though your recording will play continuously when you send it to your friends or add it to your Story.</span></p>

<b>SnapMap:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SnapMap caused a huge amount of controversy when it launched and stated it could add a big risk, with people afraid that the feature could expose anyone&#8217;s privacy and location which is especially dangerous to children. You can access it by pinching the camera screen and hide from fellow Snapchat users by tapping the Settings icon and enabling Ghost Mode.</span></p>
<p><b><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15546 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/snap-map-759-300x167.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="237" /></b><br />
