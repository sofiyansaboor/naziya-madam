										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet industry is evolving rapidly day-by-day and with everyone moving fast-breaking things, it’s easy to fall behind on the news that really matters. Therefore it’s our obligation to provide you with the latest happenings and keep you updated. Here we go:</span>
<h2><b>Update 1: </b></h2>
<h2><b>WhatsApp is now labeling your forward messages as “Forwarded”</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Facebook-owned messaging application &#8211; </span><b>WhatsApp</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; has introduced a new update where </span><b><i>users can view the label for the forwarded messages as Forwarded</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It will indicate the messages you receive that have been forwarded to you.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-12-at-6.50.15-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17371 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-12-at-6.50.15-PM.png" alt="" width="354" height="263" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The update has been declared by the <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000645/Labeling-Forwarded-Messages?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp in the blog</a> with an aim to differentiate the context that will help to make one-on-one and groups chat easier to follow. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also help to understand whether the message has been originally personalized and written by your friend/relative or been forwarded from someone else. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To see this new forwarding label, you need to have the latest supported version of WhatsApp on your phone.</span>
<h2><b>Update 2: </b></h2>

The Facebook sister company shared the update on its blog stating this update is to make the content on the app more interactive and realistic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom, Instagram will be evolving with more interesting updates not only to attract more video or content creators but also to add a consistent stream of resources to its toolbox for brands and advertisers. </span>
<h2><b>Update 3: </b></h2>
<h2><b>Reddit has added 13 different call-to-action options for advertisers. </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit has rolled out 13 new amazing </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditads/comments/8xeocv/introducing_calltoaction_buttons_for_ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Call-to-Action buttons for advertisers</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help them to be creative within ads. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertisers can view these amazing CTA buttons in a drop-down menu in the Ads Dashboard toward the bottom of the Ad Creation Page. The features are available in the newly redesigned application on the desktop, mobile, and Reddit app.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-12-at-6.49.03-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17370 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-12-at-6.49.03-PM.png" alt="" width="438" height="425" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Update 4: </b></h2>
<h2><b>Twitter is removing non-validated accounts </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter is all geared up to improve the health of its platform by removing all the not-so-required users. Its new content policy is all set to detect unusual behavior like tweeting unnecessary updates, sharing misleading links or the accounts that have been blocked by a large number of users. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In case users fall in the same category, they need to validate the account and reset their password. If they don’t follow the same, their accounts will get locked and they won’t be able to log in again. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the <a href="https://marketingland.com/twitter-is-removing-locked-accounts-from-follower-counts-244150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounts that have been locked will be removed from the followers’ account</a> as well. With this change, users will definitely notice a slight change in follower numbers, with most seeing as little as four or fewer followers removed from their follow list.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand this may be hard for some, but we believe accuracy and transparency make Twitter a more trusted service for public conversation,” writes Twitter’s head of legal, policy, and trust and safety teams, Vijaya Gadde on the Twitter blog.</span>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat is one of the trendy apps launched in 2011, especially famous among the young population to communicate and share their current moments using snaps more than written text. It’s a photo messaging app that let users send images and videos that disappear after a set amount of time (24 hrs) for the audience or Snapchat users. Ideally, users can send snaps to multiple friends at once or add them to their Stories (Snaps), a feed of the images they have recently posted that can be watched by anyone who follows them. Anyone can also send private messages, and make voice and video calls.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15535 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bollywood-Celebrity-Snapchat-Usernames-Sonakshi-Sinha-AsliSonaSnap-169x300.png" alt="" width="265" height="470" /></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, in an ad commercial, Snapchat claimed itself as a </span><b>New Kind of Camera</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sabotaging the existence of other photo messaging apps such as Instagram, Vero etc. Snapchat always has an awareness issue and with such a non-existence figurine especially not among above 25-years generation slot, Snapchat is running its first TV campaign during the Final Four on TBS -American basic cable and satellite television channel and Youtube. The “</span><b>60-second spot &#8211; A New Kind of Camera</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” aims to explain Snap’s mission to be a “camera” company and is more educational than it is entertaining. The ad was created internally and the full 60-second and a 30-second version running on TV in prime-time, cable and syndication slots for the next two months.</span><br />
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfqABVVN9ck" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat is famous for running clever, usually regional, out-of-home ads and campaigns in the past, but this campaign marks one of the company’s first earnest advertising efforts. It has launched a broader digital campaign, including digital versions of the ad and the website whatis.snapchat.com to educate consumers about the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat has also stated a few stats about the app to pitch the worth of the app to its customers like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average Snapchatter spends 30 minutes with the app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 3.5 billion pieces of content are created every day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the average user creates 20 pieces of content daily, per Snap’s own data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2017, Snapchat had about 187 million daily active users.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign comes at a critical time for Snapchat where CEO Evan Spiegel’s focus for the past 18 months is in positioning Snapchat as a camera company, has begun manufacturing and selling video-recording Spectacles since Snapchat created the Snap Inc. corporate name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> During the conference in February, Spiegel said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Snap really, very early on I think, began capitalizing on this idea that not only are cameras software but they are connected to each other.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This states that you can use the Snapchat camera for multiple purposes like for talking, learning about the world, storytelling, etc rather than just clicking pictures. With the evolution of cameras, Snapchat is definitely going to be the next generation Camera.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike most social networking platforms, the app&#8217;s messaging services are entirely mobile-based. if you are considering using Snapchat for your online marketing purpose, your smartphone can become a crucial marketing tool. As I have mentioned earlier that Snapchat is widely used among millennials, therefore, consider your target audience before committing to the platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Snapchat features that one should know:</b></p>
<p><b>Shoot 60 Second Snaps:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is quite a common and well aware feature where Android and iOS users can record up to 60 seconds of Snapchat footage (snaps) with Multi-Snap. Previously the Snapchat limit was only 10 seconds moved to 60 seconds on demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The procedure is very simple, all you need to do is tap and hold the center-circular Record button, and keep holding it for up to 60 seconds. Snapchat will split the footage into 10-second segments, which you can edit individually, though your recording will play continuously when you send it to your friends or add it to your Story.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15536 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Snapchat-Multi-Snap-171x300.png" alt="" width="217" height="380" /><br />

<b>Create your own Geofilter:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can create Geofilters for many occasions or happening places such as weddings, parties, birthdays, or even places that are special to you. For the same, you need to Go to Snapchat Settings, click On-Demand Geofilters, and choose when and where you would like to appear.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15538 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/geofilters-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="463" height="261" /><br />
<b>Use Multiple Filters:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve applied a filter to your snap, tap and hold the screen with one finger and swipe with another to layer another filter on top of it.</span></p>

<b>SnapMap:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SnapMap caused a huge amount of controversy when it launched and stated it could add a big risk, with people afraid that the feature could expose anyone&#8217;s privacy and location which is especially dangerous to children. You can access it by pinching the camera screen and hide from fellow Snapchat users by tapping the Settings icon and enabling Ghost Mode.</span></p>
<p><b><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15546 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/snap-map-759-300x167.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="237" /></b><br />

<p>Many of these features must be new for some people. If yes, then my purpose is solved. I hope you like the article. Please do share in the comment section, how you feel &#8211; Snapchat is a New Camera for our generation or not?</p>
