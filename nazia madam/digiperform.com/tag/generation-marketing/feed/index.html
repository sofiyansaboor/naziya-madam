<span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketer should master all the various methods of targeting or segmenting the audience according to the business requirement. For example, if you are into selling fashionable clothes, your targeting audience would more emphasis on youth rather than the audience belong to an older section. Similarly, if you are into selling books, you will target your audience as per their reading preferences; like fiction, non-fiction, biographies, etc </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These targeted <a href="https://digiperform.com/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital marketing strategies</a> help marketers as well businessmen to connect with the audiences which involve a deep understanding of the age group, preferences, demographics, and generations.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, targeting the right audience on these platforms will determine your unconditional success of marketing strategies. Wrong targeting can lead to deep stress and no results. Like, Instagram would be more effective for targeting Generation X audience for lifestyle products.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, we will discuss why an ideal marketer should practice the generation marketing for targeting and connecting with the potential audience.  </span>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s start with the basics:</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What is Generation Marketing?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers would have got a rough idea what is generation marketing by just reading the word “Generation”. If still figuring out what is all about, it basically refers that </span><b><i>you market or target a specific generation of a people based on the preferences, attitudes, and upbringing; for your products or service. </i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It ‘s really a great strategy to target your potential audience by understanding their age groups, preferences and activities. Understanding generation marketing helps you to switch your blind mass marketing strategies to tailoring as well as customizing for specific age groups.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you are a blogger who writes about party life and pubs around the cities. The age group of your targeting audience will be between 16 to 35 years who will be interested to know more about the party life than the people falling in the age group of above 35. Along with that, you will be targeting them on their behavior patterns like places with bars or roof side ambiance, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By understanding the behavior and patterns of your audiences or customers, you will gain a competitive advantage because you will be meeting your audiences’ needs and understanding their individual needs as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential audience or customer is your target audience who is interested to read about your blog or purchase the product or service you are offering; is ultimately referred as “</span><b><i>Lead</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in the digital marketing world.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting the audience as per the generation marketing is a way to capture the same lead &#8211; meaning you club them to take the </span><b><i>first step &#8211; awareness-  in your marketing as well as sales cycle &#8211; i.e. <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-chapter-2-how-content-marketing-relates-to-marketing-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing funnel</a>.</i></b>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Types of Generations in Generation Marketing</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the marketing world, the living generations have been divided up into the following 6 categories:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>GI Generation</strong> – Born between 1901 and 1926</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Silent Generation</strong> – Born between 1927 and 1945</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Baby Boomers</strong> &#8211; Born between 1946 to 1964</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Generation X</strong> &#8211;  Born between 1965 to 1976</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Millennial / Generation Y</strong> &#8211; Born between 1977 to 1995</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

<h2><b>Generation Y / Millennials</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This category born between 1977 to 1995 which is far more idealistic and influential on social media platforms. However, this bracket has taken into the far more negative tone and lead far more than the credit should be given. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials are extremely vocal, active and know how to responds well when presented with brand advocated or influencers in real time. They know how to grab the opportunity to interact and build the send of loyalty at the same time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, LinkedIn is quite appreciative to this category, particularly who are looking to develop professional connections.

Ratings and reviews are also highly prized, including these will help to build better relationships with Millennials.</span>
