										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Sneak Peak:</strong></span></h3>
<strong>Read this case study to know how a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider used LinkedIn Sponsored Content to generate 38% more leads at 65% lower cost.</strong>
<strong>Company:</strong> Kinvey
<strong>Industry:</strong>  Service
<strong>Tool Used:</strong> LinkedIn Sponsored Content
<strong>Result:</strong> ­ 38% more leads @ 65% lower cost
<strong>Business Type:</strong> B2B
<h3><strong>The Brand &amp; the Story</strong></h3>
A Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider, Kinvey intends to make the building of enterprise-grade mobile apps more efficient. The brand generally makes use of content for attracting and nurturing high-quality leads across different markets. The main challenge before the brand was to generate leads from two niche audiences that would not respond to the same types of content. However, for achieving its goals, Kinvey turned to LinkedIn Sponsored Content that helped the brand reach their specific audiences with the help of engaging content to generate quality leads.
<h3><strong>Kinvey’s objective behind using LinkedIn Sponsored Content</strong></h3>
Kinvey was hunting for a new source of high-quality leads that could fill its <a href="https://zopto.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/">sales funnel</a> however the two key audiences it had, mobile-focused enterprise IT specialists and businesses that would quickly deploy mobile apps, were not easy to be found. On top of it, both the niche audiences had different taste for content and most likely would not have responded to same types of content. So, the brand needed to target their eBooks, guides, and presentations in such a way that the right prospects see the right content.
<h3><strong>Kinvey’s strategy for using LinkedIn Sponsored Content</strong></h3>
Kinvey made effective use of LinkedIn Sponsored Content that is celebrated for offering unique targeting capabilities and could easily reach its niche audiences with the right messages. Moreover, the brand could also drive qualified traffic into its lead nurture program by maximizing the reach of its eBooks and other materials as Sponsored Content appears in LinkedIn feeds across desktop, tablet and smartphone.
“We strive to create content that’s useful to businesses involved in mobile app development, and we want to bring that content directly to the people who will benefit most from it,” says Lauren Pedigo, digital marketing manager at Kinvey. “LinkedIn Sponsored Content is a natural fit for us because members are looking to expand their knowledge base—and because we could provide each of our target audiences with the content that addresses their unique business needs.”
<h3><strong>Accelerating the lead generation @ a lower cost</strong></h3>
The powerful LinkedIn targeting capabilities along with delivering the content directly into LinkedIn members’ feeds helped Kinvey generate 38% more leads at a 65% lower cost per lead in comparison to other social channels.
“We slowly tested and grew our investment each month, and the results speak for themselves,” says Pedigo.
<strong><em>Campaign Highlights:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>38% more leads than other social channels</li>
 	<li>65% lower cost per lead than other social Channels</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to generate leads using LinkedIn Sponsored Content: <span style="color: #ff6600;">Suggestions by Lauren Pedigo, Digital Marketing Manager at Kinvey</span></strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#1: Understand your goals!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“Decide what action you value as a conversion,” Pedigo says. “In our case, it’s a content offer sign up. We focus on that specific action and aim to maximize results for our budget. Measurement is imperative: If you don’t collect data on what you’re doing, you’ll never know if it’s working.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#2: Maximize the value of your leads with a nurture program!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“As a B2B company, we know that people don’t become a lead and then buy a product the next day,” she explains. “We educate and nurture our leads so when they’re ready to buy, our brand is top of mind. We use marketing automation software to run nurture email campaigns, score leads, and then forward qualified leads to our sales team. Nurturing gives us the maximum benefit of the leads we acquire through LinkedIn’s Sponsored Content. If we didn’t nurture our leads, we’d miss out on the vast majority of people who are interested in learning about our product and purchasing at a later time.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#3: Match your content to your audience!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“We serve specific content to targeted audiences and organize LinkedIn advertising campaigns around those audiences,” Pedigo says. “Customizing copy and artwork around audiences is a </em><em>high priority. If we’re serving eBook content around mobile strategy best practices, we’ll use different art and copy that resonates with a CMO versus a CTO.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#4: Test multiple targeting facets and creatives!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“We’re running 20 to 50 campaigns weekly and continuously A/B testing different copy and artwork,” Pedigo says. “We make adjustments in real time. For example, we discovered that using cool colors such as green, blue, and purple in ad artwork improved our CTR by 25 percent. We compare CTR diligently because we know that LinkedIn, like every social platform, optimizes for CTR and shows content less often when engagement drops. That’s why we prioritize refreshing art and copy for Sponsored Content every week.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#5: Seek campaign ideas from across your company!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“We get ideas for content from both our sales and engineering teams,” says Pedigo. “The marketing team is perpetually talking with sales about the types of questions they receive from leads. We also talk with engineering about topics that are emerging in the mobile space. In terms of process, we have an outsourced writer interview our developers about a topic we choose and then they place the content of the interview into an eBook. We have an in-house graphic designer that does the creative for all eBooks.”</em></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Sneak Peak:</strong></span></h3>
<strong>Read this case study to know how a university used LinkedIn Sponsored InMails for lead generation and achieved a 400% increase in conversions.</strong>
<strong> </strong><strong>Company:</strong> Duke University
<strong>Industry:</strong>  Education
<strong>Tool Used:</strong> LinkedIn Sponsored Inmails
<strong>Result:</strong> ­ 400% more conversions
<strong>Business Type:</strong> B2B/ B2C
<h3><strong>The Brand: Duke University</strong></h3>
A private research university located in Durham, North Carolina, United States, Duke University was founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838. The school however moved to Durham in 1892. The university&#8217;s campus spans over 8,600 acres (3,500 hectares) on three neighboring campuses in Durham including a marine lab in Beaufort.
<h3><strong>The Story: Seeing sky-high conversion rates with Sponsored InMails</strong></h3>
Duke University had three main challenges that were identifying the qualified prospects for its unique MBA program in target global regions including India, Russia, and Latin America, educating the prospects on program’s unique value proposition and encouraging email signups for requesting more information. The brand made use of Sponsored InMails targeted by seniority, geography, &amp; degree and could exhibit an open rate of 68% and a 400% increase in conversions with a cost per lead of 10% less than other channels as well as 300% increase in sales pipeline closure speed.
<h3><strong>Endorsing a unique MBA program</strong></h3>
Cross Continent MBA program by Duke University has a unique value proposition that was not easy to be conveyed through the traditional ad formats. “Recruiting working professionals into our global programs has always been a challenge, because our concept is that you continue in role while earning a world-class MBA,” says Elizabeth Hogan, associate dean for global marketing at Duke. “Yet when high-potential professionals in emerging markets think about business school, they assume it involves quitting their jobs to do an MBA program in another country, or attending a local school in the evenings or on weekends.”
Though, the university was getting majority of applications to the program through word-of-mouth referrals, it wanted to market the program to the new prospects in different global regions who otherwise won’t have learned about it.
Having realized the potential of LinkedIn marketing Duke’s marketing team turned to it for targeting the ideal candidates all over the globe. “LinkedIn is a professional network for people who are interested in furthering their career, which is a natural fit for people who are interested in developing their careers through an MBA program,” says Hogan.
Through LinkedIn’s InMail solution they got the ideal method for explaining their program’s feature. Now, they could deliver a detailed email message explaining the program’s features and including a call-to-action for prospects to sign up for information. Once, they received the information from visitors, their admissions counselors then followed up with qualified prospects for encouraging the program applications.
“This campaign gave us an opportunity to target the right people and make them aware of this program, and it was phenomenally successful,” Hogan adds.
<h3><strong>GenX Sponsored InMail tool</strong></h3>
A longtime LinkedIn customer, Duke had anyway used Sponsored InMails successfully in the past however the productivity of the its most recent campaign went far beyond all of their expectations.
<strong>The main benefits of the most recent campaign and numerous upgrading to Sponsored InMail tool for Duke included:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Real-time delivery: Sponsored InMails were only received by the prospects when they were actively using the LinkedIn platform that increases the open rates</li>
 	<li>Optimized mobile design features: the use of a compelling call-to-action made it simple for prospects in clicking through</li>
 	<li>Organized, personalized native inbox experience</li>
</ul>
The changes that the Duke team made led to a significant impact on Duke’s campaign performance lifting the conversions in certain regions by even 400%. In 2013, Duke generated 150 leads from a spend of $10,000 on an InMail program in Russia.
“This time, we’re spending half as much in that region and have had twice as many leads,” says Hogan.
<h3><strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9413 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Duke-solution.png" alt="Duke-solution" width="365" height="418" /></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Compressing the sales pipeline </strong></h3>
If you talk about this MBA program, the time between a prospective student expressing interest and he / she enrolling was little too longer that of approximately 18 months however the brand could overcome this concern with the hep of LinkedIn Sponsored InMails.
But thanks to the recent InMail campaign, says Hogan, “we have two students starting in August who had never heard of this program when they received our InMail in March. In the history of my marketing experience at this school, I’ve never seen us convert that quickly.”
Though, it was not for the first time that Duke had experimented with a variety including Sponsored InMails for promoting the Cross-Continent MBA program, they never saw such stellar results before. According to Hogan along with the LinkedIn Sponsored InMail platform’s upgraded delivery &amp; optimization features it was her team’s focus on continually analyzing results for optimizing the messaging &amp; targeting activities in order to improve the outcomes.
“My mantra is that whatever experiments you run, be rigorous in tracking them so your organization can learn lessons from year after year and campaign after campaign,” says Hogan.
<h3><strong>Words by Elizabeth Hogan, Associate Dean, Global Marketing, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University</strong></h3>
<blockquote><em>“One of the extraordinary things about this InMail campaign is that we have two students starting in August who had never heard of this program when they received our InMail in March. In the history of my marketing experience at this school, I’ve never seen us convert that quickly.”</em></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Sneak Peak:</strong></span></h3>
<strong>Read this case study to know how an online university used remarketing on Google Display Network for re-engaging the site visitors and doubled its conversions at lower costs.</strong>
<strong> </strong><strong>Company:</strong> Western Governors University (WGU)
<strong>Industry:</strong>  Education
<strong>Tool Used:</strong> Remarketing on Google Display Network
<strong>Result:</strong> ­ 2X increase in conversions
<strong>Business Type:</strong> B2B/ B2C
<h3><strong>The Brand: Western Governors University (WGU)</strong></h3>
An online university, Western Governors University (WGU) is committed to increasing access to higher education through online, competency-based degree programs. Being one of the nonprofit institutions formed by the governors of 19 U.S. states, the university is recognized for delivering one of the best values in online education.
<em>“We’ve always had to spend money wisely because part of our mission is to keep tuition low, and at the same time, we have to compete against for-profit online universities,” says Mandi Hudson, online marketing manager at WGU. “In marketing and across the university, for us, every dollar really does count.”</em>
<h3><strong>Hunting for the deserving candidates </strong></h3>
With a growth rate of 30% over the past decade, WGU ensures to customize its marketing efforts in such as a way that they enroll only those students who aspire to become graduates and not just fill seats.
Hudson, who is herself a graduate of WGU, says, “We’re not looking for students. We’re looking for future graduates. Our marketing efforts are focused on ensuring we find people who don’t just want to fill seats but are serious about earning their diplomas and moving forward in their careers.”
Though WGU’s marketing team makes use of both traditional &amp; online marketing in its marketing mix for finding these future graduates however the majority of students they get come from online marketing and referrals.
She says, “Online marketing has been important to the continuing growth of the university because our chances of getting in front of the right people — people actively interested in our product — are generally higher online.”
<h3><strong>Turning to Remarketing for prospective opportunities</strong></h3>
Till the end of the 2009, the online methods that WGU employed included an assortment of search, Google TV ads, and a range of text &amp; banner ads across the Google Display Network.
However, the university was still in the hunt of new ideas rather cost-saving new ideas. It was the time its Google account team brought in the idea of remarketing. With the help of remarketing they could re-engage those who’ve previously visited their website while browsing the sites across Google Display Network.
According to Hudson they were immediately drawn to the prospective opportunities. “It was something we had never seen before, and the idea that you could stay in front of people you’ve already worked so hard to bring to your website was mind-blowing.”
<h3><strong>Re-engaging the site visitors through Remarketing</strong></h3>
It didn’t even take a week, the marketing team at WGU made a few tweaking to the website code for beginning its remarketing campaign. This allowed the university to tag various pages of its website and display ads customized according to those pages to the visitors who visited the respective pages while browsing the Google Display Network. In the initial days they showed the image ads only however later on they added text and video ads.
“Remarketing gives us the opportunity to stay in front of potential graduates as they continue on from our site to research other universities. We’re able to offer them additional messaging that will hopefully bring them back to our site,” says Hudson.
Remarketing allowed different visitors to see different ads depending on the WGU web page they visited. Let’s say for example visitors to the home page were shown different follow-up ads in comparison to those that visit the College of Business.
“As we’ve gone along, we’ve added more tags and refined the process to make sure we’re narrowing the audience and putting relevant ads in front of site visitors,” says Hudson. “The most important thing is we know we’re getting our message in front of people who’ve already shown an interest in the university.”
<h3><strong>Doubling the conversions</strong></h3>
According to Hudson the remarketing campaign had not just yield them the results they were looking for but even beyond that. It proved to be an efficient and cost-effective way of bringing potential students for WGU back to the site.
Talking about the overall conversion rate, it was almost doubled in compare to that of the university’s search campaign. On top of it, both the cost per lead (CPL) and cost per click (CPC) for remarketing was about one-third that of the university’s search campaigns.
“The metrics have been exceptional, and as we keep adding tags and refining our process, we believe they can get even better,” says Hudson. “The bottom line is we’re now bringing in future graduates more efficiently than ever before.”
<h3><strong>Collaborating with Remarketing for ongoing marketing efforts</strong></h3>
Remarketing is now a key component of WGU’s ongoing marketing efforts and the university continues to work out new ways for driving traffic to its website and convincing the visitors to come back.
“We learned that remarketing provides a great opportunity to extend your messaging beyond your introductory hello,” says Hudson. “You can establish your brand a little bit deeper with an audience that you get to define.”
<h3><strong>Message by Mandi Hudson, Online Marketing Manager at WGU for other online marketers!</strong></h3>
<blockquote><em>“Keep moving, keep updating and keep testing new products. That’s the great thing about online marketing: You can adapt according to what’s working and what’s not. And for us, remarketing is a great product that’s really working.”</em></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Sneak Peak:</strong></span></h3>
<strong>Read this case study to know how a university uses LinkedIn marketing to boost enrollment in its online degree programs. </strong>
<strong>Company:</strong> FIU Online
<strong>Industry:</strong>  Education
<strong>Tool Used:</strong> LinkedIn Marketing
<strong>Result:</strong> 4 applications in less than 2 weeks
<strong>Business Type:</strong> B2C
<h3><strong>Reaching well targeted prospects for online degree programs</strong></h3>
A public, research-focused university based in Miami, Florida International University (FIU) has an enrollment of more than 55,000 students. FIU Online, which is the University’s online division, offers 20 undergraduate degree programs and multiple graduate degree programs in fields like business, communications, education, and engineering.
Since the programs offered by FIU Online are highly specialized, the university needed a customized approach for reaching pre-qualified prospects with job experience in each vertical market.
Initially the school made use of LinkedIn’s self-service platform for building interest in its online programs. However, when they saw some considerable results there, they increased its investment without any delay. The school worked with a dedicated account management team for leveraging both LinkedIn Sponsored Content and Sponsored InMail for building overall brand awareness and driving pre-qualified leads. For them the ultimate goal was increasing enrollment in niche professional programs.
<h3><strong>Hitting the bull’s eye </strong></h3>
Criteria such as job function, education level, and field of study were used by the FIU Online for targeting and reaching just the right audiences. For instance, while targeting for enrollment in the Master of Science in Human Resources Management, the school displayed targeted Sponsored Content only to prospects who had undergraduate degrees and were working in an HR function. However the same prospects were targeted with Sponsored InMail that offered a short but detailed message explaining the benefits of the 12-month degree program and including a call-to-action that said ‘learn more’. The strategy generated awesome results with one InMail campaign resulting in four applications in less than two weeks.

The school was not just able to reach highly targeted prospects but they also tracked the attribution of leads for making adjustments in their marketing spend accordingly.
<h4><strong><em>The campaign highlights:</em></strong></h4>
­ 4 applications in less than 2 weeks from one InMail campaign
­ Sponsored InMail open rate up to 2x LinkedIn benchmarks
­ Up to 1.8 % engagement rate on Sponsored Content
­ Ability to attribute leads directly to LinkedIn and connect on a personal level

<strong> </strong><em>“We’re always trying to find the right mix between brand awareness and lead generation, and I think that LinkedIn does a very good job of matching the two.”</em>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Sneak Peek:</strong></span></h3>
<strong>Read this case study to know how HSBC used LinkedIn Sponsored Content for driving over 40,000 interactions and attracting over 3750 followers.</strong>
<strong>Company:</strong> HSBC
<strong>Industry:</strong>  Banking
<strong>Tool Used:</strong> LinkedIn Sponsored Content
<strong>Result:</strong> More than 40,000 interactions and over 3750 followers
<strong>Business Type:</strong> B2 B
<h3><strong>The Brand: HSBC</strong></h3>
One of the world’s largest banking &amp; financial services organizations, HSBC is headquartered in London. The bank aims at connecting customers to opportunities and enabling businesses to flourish and economies to thrive. This is what acts as foundation of the HSBC Global Connections website as well, which has abundant insightful &amp; expert content, reports, and tools for inspiring and informing businesses operating internationally or planning to do so.
<h3><strong>HSBC objective behind LinkedIn Marketing</strong></h3>
HSBC wanted to form collaborations with members of its key business audience.
“Our challenge is to be seen as a strategic partner rather than just a transactional partner,”says Amanda Rendle, global head of marketing, HSBC Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets.
“We need to find new and innovative ways to engage an audience short on time but hungry for insight that can help take their business further.”
Driving awareness and establishing through leadership among its busy audience happened naturally for HSBC as Sponsor content went well with the quality of the LinkedIn audience and the business professional context.
<h3><strong>HSBC’s strategy for LinkedIn Marketing</strong></h3>
HSBC wanted to endorse its new Trade Forecast Tool for which the company chose to leverage the geographic targeting capabilities of Sponsored Content using personalized statuses on the basis of data relevant to each market.
“The advantage for us is the opportunity to signpost our content and make it more easily accessible, not only to our customers but to a wider business audience,” Rendle explains. “Sponsored Content allows us to select content that we feel has greatest relevance at a particular time or on a particular topic, and then to highlight it to an interested audience by placing it in the LinkedIn feed. We’ve been able to test different variables and optimize as we go along.”
LinkedIn marketing also enabled HSBC in developing and validating a content strategy useful for its target business audience.
“As we develop our content strategy, we can assess our customers’ need for certain information by promoting key articles, research or topics, and seeing what kind of response we get,” highlights Rendle. “This  kind of insight is invaluable in our mission to become more customer centric.”

<h3><strong>The Success</strong></h3>
Sponsored Content proved to be very productive for the HSBC and the bank was able to:
<ul>
 	<li>­ Drive more than 40,000 interactions with HSBC Global Connections content</li>
 	<li>­ Boost organic update impressions by 1500% and social interactions by 900%</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Words by Amanda Rendle, Global Head of Marketing, Commercial &amp; Global Banking and Markets, HSBC</strong></h3>

LinkedIn’s Sponsored Content has helped us with this by enabling us to deliver timely updates to influential </em><em>professionals, and stimulate debate and interaction.”</em></blockquote><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/hsbc-used-linkedin-sponsored-content-add-3750-followers/">How HSBC Used LinkedIn Sponsored Content to add 3750 followers</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

<div class="containt">Talking about this unique initiative, Siddharth Banerjee, National Head, Brand and Consumer Insights, Vodafone India, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“With visual content gaining popularity especially among younger consumers, emojis have a broad play across all demographics. Vodafone India has always been at the forefront of providing innovative and user friendly mobile internet experience for its customers in India. Our partnership with Twitter and the customised brand emojis was yet another step in our ongoing endeavour to make mobile internet more fun, smart, engaging and easy. This innovative initiative to engage with social media savvy customers saw much success and we will be further integrating these ZooZoo emojis into our marketing and ad campaigns on social media”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the idea of introducing Zoozoo as an emoji, Taranjeet Singh, Business Head of India, Twitter, said,</p>

			<p>Ola is one of the leading cab service provider of India. Presently, It has presence in about 85 major India cities that help people roaming at reasonable rates, and provide commuters an option to book a cab either an online or through its smart phone app.<br />
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ola1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-5643 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ola1.png" alt="Ola1" width="645" height="502" /></a></p>
<p>Objective behind <a href="https://digiperform.com/social-media-marketing-course/">Facebook marketing</a> Campaign<br />
Despite being so many social networking sites in the market, Ola determined to make use of Facebook to run its first campaign because penetration of users on it is very high. With Facebook, the brand gets freedom to target right people, at right time while with any offline or even online channel the brand cannot increase awareness in such short span. That&#8217;s why Ola used Facebook to run its #ChaloNiklo campaign so as to increase awareness about its brand.<br />
Ola strategy for Facebook marketing<br />
In order to make campaign a success, Ola shared targeted and engaging photo ads and video ads featuring content of its #Chaloniklo campaign. All featuring content included captivating call-to-action thereby people might propel to download Ola cabs app. Ola also used Facebook to route people to their website, and also ran mobile app ads to redirect populace to Ola cabs app.<br />
Primarily, Ola targeted people who were working professionals aged between 21 to 40.  Further segregated target people on demographic and gender basis. In addition for generating quick outcome the company targeted consumers on location basis, particularly leading Indian cities.<br />
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Olacabs-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-5644 size-full aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Olacabs-1.png" alt="Olacabs 1" width="492" height="595" /></a><br />
Facebook Helped Ola to increase sales<br />
With Facebook campaign, the consumer acquisition rate increased and searches concerning Ola cabs also increased, sales boost up by 60% as a result.<br />
Hence, Ola chose Facebook over other digital media means because it has largest user base across India. The targeted campaign setting makes it more reachable and gives companies a high return on investment. However, with FB marketing, app users increased, the company began getting maximum booking as a result. Remarketing targeted those who might have watched our first campaign called #Chaloniklo.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Paints_Ltd">Asian paints</a>, one of the leading manufacturers in paint and coating has digitally transformed their business in three key areas of their enterprises: customer experience, operational processes and business models. Through this digital transformation, the firm has been able to maintain fast growth and globalize to increase their efficiency while reducing its impact on the environment.
<strong>Introduction</strong>
The company started an initiative in 2000s to reduce debt and improve their internal efficiencies. They decided to implement an enterprise-wide ERP and Advanced Supply Chain Management System. This further helped them in creating an enterprise-wide platform that was the basis for further improvements in sales and customer processes. This initiative also liberated working capital that helped fund acquisitions in emerging markets. The organization also linked sub-contractors and suppliers on a B2B portal that helped to further improve their efficiencies. Finally, in 2013, the firm invested in a CRM system.
<strong>Real Transformation</strong>
There was another transformation initiated by the firm in 2010. They now centralized their order taking process into a single corporate call centre. This change helped them to improve their operational efficiencies while sustaining their growth. In customer-facing processes, this move also encouraged retailers to place their orders through the call centre where they would now receive a more consistent service level than they could through the firm’s 100 local depots. Moreover, the centralized data process also facilitated delivery of products to large institutional customer job sites, giving their customers a capability, which their competitors couldn’t provide.
<strong>Result of this transformation</strong>
One of the biggest changes that was noticed after centralising order taking process was the way in which the sales people interacted with the retailers. The sales team was now liberated from those annoying order collection processes and focussed more on building stronger relationships. Furthermore, in order to ensure a more meaningful interaction between the sales team and the retailer, the company provided the sales people with vital customer data in the field using mobile devices. A rollout of tablet devices, which is currently underway, will further mobile-enable the sales staff.

Asian paint witnesses a high growth in paint demand, which further creates a need for new manufacturing plants in every three years. Looking at the scale and size of these plants, the firm has now begun to focus on creating highly automated plants.
This automation has helped the organization to achieve greater scalability, quality and stronger safety and environmental protections. These new plants are fully integrated from an information management perspective. Data from shop floor systems and automated warehouses are linked seamlessly to the ERP which has helped the firm to sustain the firm’s operational efficiencies.
<strong>New Service Strategy</strong>
In India, the company has now started to sell services instead of products. They now offer service of painted wall rather than selling a can of paint. This service strategy has benefitted beyond new revenues.
Selling services helps the organization to ensure that their high end products are applied properly, which further helps in improving customer satisfaction. Moreover, selling services also helps the firm to get closer to the end-customer, understand core customer choices and also launch high-end texture finishes.
Another advantage of having a contractor in a client’s house helps to yield information for the marketing staff as they can understand the customer preferences as well as potential demands. Gaining better knowledge of end-customer preferences is a high priority for the company, since its business model – operating largely through retailers – means that customer involvement has been traditionally very low.
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Corporate growth as well as new technology demands has increased the challenges of digital governance.
