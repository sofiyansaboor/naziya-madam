</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring content marketing ROI is a difficult challenge to cater because of these non-tangible factors. But there are many ways to measure these metrics as well. The fact is that no one won’t invest in content marketing if it’s not result oriented or not generating positive results for the business. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>So, how do you measure content marketing ROI? </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the most common content marketing metrics that you can use to measure your success:</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Brand Awareness</b></span></h2>

However, it&#8217;s difficult to prove its worth to return on investment (ROI).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although tough to measure and tie directly to revenue, you can track your progress by looking at:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social shares and following</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog views</span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever your audience engages, you can make analysis of what they like or what they don’t; their biggest challenges and what they want to know from you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to find out like:  </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media shares, likes, and comments</span></li>

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Search Engine Visibility</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we already have read before in beginner’s guide to content marketing, SEO plays a big role in generating the right traffic for your website. Getting your content rank on top of the first page Google search engine is always a dream goal for any content marketer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To track your content progress as per SEO strategy, be sure to look at your keyword rankings at least once per quarter, but we suggest pulling reports once per month. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other metrics that you need to track along with SEO:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website traffic from organic search</span></li>

&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Sales</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, fighting for all the great marketing goals and tracking them each month or quarterly; few marketers/businessmen understand the language of Sales only. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing is a valuable tool for moving leads through the inbound marketing funnel and turning visitors into leads and leads into customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To track your success in using the content for sales, monitor these metrics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead to customer conversion rate (overall and by content piece)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales conversion rates</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length of your sales cycle</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contract size</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost per lead</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Retention and Upsells</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, retaining your audience and upselling them again. This is the most difficult but mandatory goal of content marketing to improve retention and driving upsell. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But creating for your personas shouldn’t end just because someone becomes a customer. Instead, now is the time for you to delight your customers and make them a “</span><b>Happy Customer Forever</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your customer is happy with your product or services, there are 100 percent chances he/she would recommend your business to other people. This is the time when we can’t ignore our happy customers. They are likely to trust you, would love to make more purchases and drive more revenue through upsells. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few metrics to track toward this goal:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer retention rate</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percentage of repeat customers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue from upsells</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Is there any formula to calculate content marketing ROI?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take a simple calculative way to measure the content marketing ROI from <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convince and Convert</a>:</span>
<span style="color: #993300;"><b><i>“Return minus investment, divided by investment, expressed as a percentage”.</i></b></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example,</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone has spent $500 on creating a piece of content, and receiving leads worth $2000, then your ROI is 300%:</span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$2000-$500 = $1500</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1500/$500 = 3</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">3 x 100% = 300%</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Conclusion:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it’s difficult to show how content marketing is performing and generate ROI, these metrics can give you a better sense of performance and how your content is helping with the goals.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By putting the right content with the right tactics, you will be able to generate more traffic, lead and sales to please your businesses or bosses. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, content marketing is worth an investment.</span>
