			<p><b>Want A Boost In Your Venture? Here Are Top Reasons Why You Need A Mobile-Friendly Website</b></p>
<p><b><i>It is said that old is gold. However, that’s not how it goes with technology. </i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the advancement of technology day by day, the entire genre of marketing, advertisement, and e-commerce has changed. Gone are those days when traditional paper pamphlets or word-of-mouth publicity would have taken your venture sky high.</p>
<p>Nowadays to tap into the global market scenario, and to be the global leader you need a properly designed and enticing mobile responsive website.</p>
<p>So if you want a boost in your business, then it’s high time for you to develop a <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-10-reasons-why-you-need-a-mobile-friendly-website/">mobile responsive website</a>.</p>
<p><b>Numbers and Stats</b></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/">report from Statista</a> shows that the total number of mobile phone users all across the globe is expected to reach 4.68 billion by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>And hence, true to its saying, those ventures that are still not into catering to mobile users through their web pages are surely paving way for their extinction.</p>
<p><b>A brief march of time</b></p>
<p>The concept of designing mobile-friendly web pages isn’t that old. The first website that can adapt according to the browser viewpoint was designed and launched by a car giant around 2001. The terms fluid, flexible, liquid, and elastic were a few synonyms used in mobile-friendly webpage designs until in 2010 a developer phased responsive web design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasons for designing a mobile-responsive website</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Increasing the availability and traffic of a website: </b>Mobile phones are easy to use and the availability of the internet has made it possible for users to access the web page at any point anywhere. Desktop or laptops aren’t always available to a website that is not mobile-friendly already pushes away more than half of its traffic to a competitor mobile responsive site.</p>
<p><b>2. Experience class apart:</b> A crucial aspect for any website is its experience as perceived by the users. When a website is used in a mobile or tablet interface, it changes its design from an evenly designed page to a vertical configuration.  This transformation in configuration brings in a number of displays and designs together.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.tisdigital.com/responsive-website-design.php">method of configuration is known as Responsive Website Design</a> (RWD), where the website properly fits according to the screen size of the gadget by contracting pictures, displays, and contents thus providing the user with a class experience without tiresome navigation.</p>
<p><b>3. Cost-effectiveness</b>:  For designing any website every entrepreneur thinks about the cost. Strange as it might occur to you, a mobile-friendly page is in fact, cost-effective. Before the advent of RWD design, people had to design different websites for different platforms thus doubling or tripling the building cost. However, with a responsive design, a single site can serve all.</p>
<p><b>4. Increase in sales</b>: Of course, the ultimate purpose for designing a website is marketing the brand across platforms. With the advent of smartphones and easy internet, the prominence of e-commerce is gaining day by day.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.studio98.com/5-reasons-website-mobile-friendly/">report showed in 2013</a>, that there were only 10% of districts buying online goods through mobiles whereas within two years that rate doubled. So it goes without saying that a mobile responsive site will tap on a huge customer pool.</p>
<p><b>5. </b><b>Improved Google rankings: </b>This is beyond any doubt that Google is the biggest search engine of all time. A report suggested that more than 96% of users use Google as their primary search engine. Thus Search Engine Optimization ranks to become a deciding factor for the number of hits on the website.</p>
<p>From the user end, the only first few in lists are generally checked. A mobile-responsive user-friendly website is recognized by Google and is given a higher SEO rank thus getting it more hits from potential targeted customers.</p>
<p><b>6. Enhancement of loading speeds</b>:  Now speed and fast connectivity act as a key factor for any website. According to standards set by ‘Google Page Speed Developers’, the content on the top of a page should load under 1 second and the rest of the page within 2-3 seconds.</p>
<p>These ridiculously high-speed standards cannot be reached by a desktop webpage as they are evenly designed and are a lot heavier. The prolonged time for a page to load acts as a major turn down for customers and instead of waiting they prefer to move to a user-friendly website.</p>
<p><b>7. Optimizing the page elements</b>: A mobile responsive web page adjusts according to the screen size but with all the contents, graphics and displays. So, the user experience is much effectual and customers can find all the information they are looking for.</p>
<p><b>8. Analytics friendly</b>: Customer analytics refers to future planning, rectification, and implementations for any venture. However creating analytics reports for customer preferences, logins for multiple versions of sites, and tracking all such through a multitude of conversion paths, redirects, funnels are complex and has high chances of data mishap.</p>
<p>However, a mobile responsive site is easier to maintain and document all analytics. Some major analytics like Google Analytics nowadays caters and merges all the reports of mobile-responsive pages into a single one.</p>
<p><b>9. Improved offline browsing: </b>Another latest feature is offline browsing. With HTML5-enabled smartphones, mobile-responsive pages enable users to continue viewing the contents within the HTML5 web app even without an internet connection<b>.</b></p>
<p><b>10. Lower Maintenance</b><b>: </b>A responsive page is all fits within one design. So while designing or while maintaining it creates a lesser headache for testing, bug fixing and optimizing thus giving you more time to focus on content and marketing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>To sum it up</h3>
<p>While we reach the end of the discussion, it’s evident that mobile phones are the future and thus a mobile-responsive web page is the only solution that reduces your time and efforts on one end while giving you more customers, and business on the other. Entrepreneurs, marketers, and business owners gain the opportunity to reach out to a customer pool that engages with their brand and its offerings, which in turn shoots up their ROIs.</p>

			<p>With more businesses moving into the digital space, competition for organic traffic has increased, and now those companies are trying to outplay each other in terms of ranking on search engines.</p>
<p>Countless internet users browse for products each day, so it’s safe to say that the higher your business ranks on search engine results pages (SERPs), the higher your chances of closing sales and gaining profits.</p>
<p>Of course, more traffic doesn’t necessarily translate to more sales, but it’s a major factor in getting conversions.</p>
<p>Some businesses have taken advantage of search engine optimization (SEO) to rank ahead of the rest, and they’re benefiting from it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, others have made several SEO mistakes, and this has negatively affected their operations as it has become difficult for buyers to find them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, SEO errors aren’t permanent and can be remedied at any time. With the help of <a href="https://scopicsoftware.com/marketing/seo/">SEO specialists</a> or any agency that provides <a href="https://polianna.net/services/">white label SEO service</a>, you can get your business website back to where you want it to be.</p>
<p>Here are some of the SEO mistakes you might unknowingly be committing and how to correct them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>1. Messy URL Structures</b></h3>
<p>Some businesses don’t put too much effort into their URL structure, which is often a grave SEO mistake.</p>
<p>A URL tells search engines what your page is about, and a good one would make it easy for your site to rank on the keywords that potential and existing customers are searching for.</p>
<p>A messy URL structure doesn’t include keywords that have to do with the page it leads to.</p>
<p>When visitors come across the web address, they won’t know what the page is all about right away.</p>
<p>Even when the keyword is added to it, it may contain stop words, which add no value to the ranking and only makes the URL longer, which negatively affects ranking.</p>
<p>Such mistakes should be avoided or remedied if you’ve been making them. Here are some ways to correct a messy web address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include keywords in your URL but remove any stop words such as ‘the,’ ‘and,’ and ‘or.’</li>
<li>Make your URL short so it becomes effortless for search engines to point to the website and for clients to quickly get a gist of what your website is all about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying these remedies to your business website will do the trick. This is especially important for websites that use plugins and need customization in the default URL settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2. Lack Of Proper Keywords</b></h3>
<p>Keywords are words or phrases that clients use to search for products, services, and articles online.</p>
<p>One keyword can’t be deemed more ‘correct’ than another since people can use different phrases depending on their location.</p>
<p>However, your business can fail to do keyword research and end up using general phrases that are hard to rank on.</p>
<p>Also, without knowing what their clients are likely looking for, you wouldn’t know how to phrase your content to suit their searches.</p>
<p>Those problems can be fixed in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct thorough keyword research to know which phrases you have a chance to rank on. There are free and premium tools available to help you with this task.</li>
<li>Avoid general keywords or those used by businesses with higher authority because they’ll surely outrank you.</li>
<li>Check customer feedback, comments, and questions to identify the phrases they choose when looking for your products, and use them as your keywords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the right keywords in your topics, URL, and content ensures that search engines will lead buyers to your website whenever they search those phrases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>3. Lack Of Consistent And Authentic Content </b></h3>
<p>For your website to achieve a good ranking, it has to be active and contain authentic content, which should also be uploaded regularly.</p>
<p>The problem is that most businesses fail to adhere to this, and they either post content that isn’t useful to their clients or is unoriginal, or they don’t post content in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>When you commit such mistakes, your traffic decreases because there’s no new or fresh content for your visitors to see.</p>
<p>Moreover, they can leave negative feedback about your website if your posts are outdated, and this I’ll negatively impact your ranking.</p>
<p>To remedy those issues, here are some of the things you should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload user-generated content, which is any form of content created by customers who’ve tried your product or requested your service. This particular type of content is usually fresh and authentic, and users provide them regularly. It gives your content team something to upload if you don’t have any new material to post. Also, since it comes from a fellow customer, your audience will more likely trust any good feedback it contains.</li>
<li>Improve collaboration between your teams that interact with clients at different levels, such as marketing and customer care support, to <a href="https://digiperform.com/content-marketing-tactics-every-marketer-should-know/">know what kind of content</a> your target audience is interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>4. Downplaying Social SEO </b></h3>
<p>Social SEO is the traffic attributed to social media platforms. Traffic comes when people on those sites click through an advert or a link. Social SEO is important because with higher traffic comes a higher ranking.</p>
<p>What’s more, social media sites give customers a chance to comment on your business, hence providing relevant feedback as well as content for your website.</p>
<p>More people in the world today use social media to interact with businesses, so you should also direct your focus and resources to your social media pages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this isn’t as common of a practice as it should be since some businesses downplay the role of social media in ranking.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to fix mistakes in your social SEO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an engaging social media page that allows people to communicate with your business. Your social media manager should also be engaging in order to retain customers in your business.</li>
<li>Promote your social media adverts to reach more people. With more visitors to your site through social media, you’ll have better social SEO and eventually a better ranking.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>5. Unresponsive Pages</b></h3>
<p>Page responsiveness is the ability of your business web pages to appear and work properly on different devices. A good website should be responsive to mobile gadgets and computers alike because it <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-responsive-web-design-benefits/211264/">benefits your SEO</a>.</p>
<p>Building a page that only responds to computers and not phones or tablets will cause you to miss out on attracting numerous visitors because most individuals browse or use the internet on mobile devices.</p>
<p>It could frustrate visitors who don’t have desktop or laptop computers, leading to higher bounce-off rates that directly affect your ranking. To remedy that, try these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a website that can display well on whatever device is used to access it. You can hire a professional website builder so you can be sure that you’ll get an outcome that’s responsive.</li>
<li>Conduct test cycles when developing the website to ensure that it’s suitable for all devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion </b></h2>
<p>SEO is crucial to any business as it helps generate organic traffic that can eventually be converted into sales.</p>
<p>Though most businesses try to optimize their pages, other common mistakes can be committed that lead to poor ranking.</p>
<p>Fortunately, those can be fixed by identifying them and trying any of the appropriate tips above.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every company wants to rank higher in search engine results, it means more visibility and more revenue to your business. </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/"><b>In 2020 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google conducted over 600,000 algorithm experiments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, resulting in over 4,500 adjustments to its search feature. So it’s important to stay in Google’s good graces to keep your site on page one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few ways in which you can do it. The first one is by building a website that is tailored to the intent of your keyword/keyphrase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way is to create content that will always be relevant for your target audience and manage to rank better than other websites in your niche.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last one, and the most important, is by optimizing your website for mobile searches which will improve the organic traffic as well as the ranking on mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of ranking higher in search engine results cannot be undermined as it helps you gain new customers, generate leads, and have more visibility among other companies in your industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also help you fight against competitors who have advantages over you due to their strong SEO activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at how you can rank your business website higher in search in more depth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Enhance the user experience on your website</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience is the most important aspect of any website. A well-designed, easy-to-use, and informative website can lead to a high ranking in search for your business. Some ways you can improve your website&#8217;s user experience include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create easy navigation for visitors to easily navigate the website</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design your website with mobile-friendly features</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a good first impression through videos and images on your homepage</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displaying user-friendly information on your homepage like contact details, announcements about new products or services, and social media profiles.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure no user has to click more than 3 times to get to where they need to be on your site.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Create keyword-rich titles and meta descriptions</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword-rich titles and meta descriptions are becoming increasingly </span><a href="https://ninepeaksmedia.com/b2b-seo-implementing-seo-for-b2b-companies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">important for B2B SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A keyword-rich title with a meta description can help you rank your website for targeted searches that have a significant number of monthly searches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good way to create a keyword-rich title is to also include the main benefit or action that your product provides. Some examples of this are &#8220;The 6 Best Ways To Find Your Next Job&#8221; or &#8220;How To Bake The Perfect Cookie In 5 Easy Steps&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta descriptions should describe what the product is, the benefits it provides, and how it solves problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating these on your website can help increase conversion rates and increase SEO rankings through high-quality content on your website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Create excellent SEO-optimized content</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To write great content, you need to know SEO best practices. You&#8217;ll need to understand how search engines work and what they&#8217;re looking for in your content so that you can make sure that it&#8217;s optimized for SEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important thing about writing great content is that it needs to be readable by humans. It is also important to think about the keywords that your readers would use when searching for a product or service like yours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order not to overwhelm the reader with information, it is good practice to break up long passages of text into smaller sections as well as paragraphs and subparagraphs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some best practices for SEO optimized content include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use H1, H2, H3 headers in your articles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use images to break up your text, Every 400-500 words is usually a good rule to follow</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a hero image at the top of your articles to grab the reader’s attention</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No keyword stuffing. Google doesn’t like this so make sure you or your writers keep keyword density below 3%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interlink between articles to help Google understand your website better. Tools like Link Whisper are excellent for this once you reach 100 articles or more</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize images for speed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the main keyword of the article early into the first paragraph</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Get more backlinks</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinks are the cornerstone of a website&#8217;s SEO. They can help propel your website to the top of search engine rankings and make you more visible in search engine results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link building is a difficult task with many obstacles. Here are some tips on how to get more backlinks for your website:</span></p>
<p><b>1. Create high-quality content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is unique and interesting enough for a reader to want to share it on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Find content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has already been written about by other sources but does not have an &#8220;About&#8221; section on its page where links can be found.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Guest blogging</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the most effective methods for earning backlinks and it has been done by many famous brands. You need to be careful when guest blogging because bloggers can sometimes take advantage of you if you don&#8217;t do your research or follow best practices.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Attracting “Link Bait” articles with unique content and infographics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can pay someone on Fiverr to create excellent and unique infographics based on some original research you carried out. In time &#8211; if done correctly &#8211; these articles and infographics will be linked to by other sites.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Content promotion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have written valuable content on a particular topic, promote it on social media and other digital platforms by highlighting the topics covered in the article. Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok allow you to laser target your audience very specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone then links to this article on their website it adds to your backlink profile, and the more backlinks the better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Improve your page speed</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Page speed is an important ranking factor for Google Search. It can have a substantial impact on your website’s search rank. You can improve page speed by optimizing images, JavaScript, and CSS file sizes and using browser caching to reduce network requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also consider using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to improve your page speed and reduce bandwidth costs. Once your site can justify the cost you can also implement tools like WP Rocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WP Rocket is a WordPress plugin that helps you manage your website faster and get more traffic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Add your business to Google Maps</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get your business listed on Google Maps, you should submit your business&#8217; address and contact information to Google. In addition, you should also include a link to your website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f you add the address of your business, it will show up in the search results when someone searches for something related to what your company does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: when someone searches for “chocolate shop near me”, their results may include stores like Ghirardelli and Godiva because they have their addresses on Google Maps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Match Your Content to Search Intent</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search intent is a term used to refer to the type of keyword searches a Google user performs. To rank higher in the search engine, your content should match your search intent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most businesses focus on using keywords that match their website’s main topic, they should also use keywords that are related but not too closely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes it easier for your content to rank in search engines and increase traffic on your website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Reduce Your Bounce Rate</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bounce rate is a metric that measures how many visitors leave your website without interacting with any of the content. It is also an important metric to understand how people find your business website and how they are responding to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to optimize your site’s search ranking, you need to know the factors that lead to a higher bounce rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three main causes of a higher bounce rate &#8211; the content on your website, poor usability, and poor user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you want visitors to navigate through your site easily and get what they need quickly, they should have an interactive layout with clear calls-to-action and well-written content.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mobile Friendliness</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With smartphone and smart device usage increasing, businesses need to be mobile-friendly. This includes the website design and the content on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some tips for designing your website and content to be mobile-friendly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use responsive or adaptive web design (AWD) in your website so that it will resize with different screen resolutions and devices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you use text sizing according to the font size of your text so that no matter what the font size is there is an optimal reading experience on all devices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a light, mobile-friendly theme such as Generate Press or Astra</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your plugins to a minimum</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize images with tools like </span><a href="https://shortpixel.com/"><b>Short Pixel</b></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Use schema markup and structured data on your website</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schema markup is a way of adding structured data to your website which helps in getting your website higher in search rankings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schema markup is an XML file that is added to the head section of the document. It tells search engines what content on your site should be taken into consideration for ranking purposes. Schema markup can be added by using a plugin or by editing the source code manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many benefits to using schema markup on your website. It helps you get ranked higher and generates more traffic from Google and other search engines as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Use tools like Ahrefs</h4>
<p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/"><b>Ahrefs software</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assists businesses by helping them to understand their competitors’ SEO strategies and tactics. </span><a href="https://mikekhorev.com/top-5-ahrefs-alternatives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Ahrefs alternatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow users to see the website analytics of their competitors and monitor changes in the search engine rankings over time.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of ranking your business website higher in search are numerous. Not only can you see more traffic from organic search, but you’ll be more likely able to use Display Ads as another source of your site’s income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re looking to improve the placement of your website in search, then the tips above will give you a strong foundation to build on.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are working on optimizing your WordPress site’s performance or any other CMS, website optimization is not an easy task. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, if you browse the website for help, there are plenty of WordPress performance optimization myths written that will confuse you.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some significant myths are that you require expensive hosting for increased speed, WordPress is not scalable, a caching plugin is enough for your website, and so forth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will be dispelling some of the most common WordPress performance optimization myths. If you haven’t already, you should bury them right away to optimize your WordPress site to its potential best. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. You require expensive hosting for increased speed</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that hosting can affect site speed. Most of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hosting providers focus on boosting performance and helping <a href="https://10web.io/blog/speed-up-wordpress/">speed up WordPress</a>. There are several types of hosting, such as shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated server hosting, cloud hosting, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t mean you need to splurge a heavy amount for that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses often opt for the shared host as it is an affordable option. However, when you share a host, the performance of other websites on that network will be slow even when you have a high-performing site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A free web hosting service is not recommended if you own a business site due to its downtime and slow speed problems. It is imperative to invest in a good host. However, understand that affordable hosting is not always bad and expensive hosting is not always good.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. WordPress is not scalable</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people worry that WordPress site performance will slow down when traffic spikes or it might crash. People probably have this fear because initially, WordPress was a blogging platform that developed into a CMS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this myth should be debunked. Even big corporations are using WordPress. In case your WordPress site goes down when traffic increases, the issue lies with your host and not WordPress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure that you have sufficient server resources. WordPress can support your site even if you have high traffic. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. You should always upload high-quality resolutions</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The layout and graphics that you add to your site significantly impact how your site looks. And it will, in turn, affect your bounce rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, uploading the highest-quality resolution images is not a great idea. When you upload a bigger resolution file, the file size is going to be big, extra work for your server to deliver the image. It will render your site slow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you can do is use tools to compress your images without losing their quality.</span></p>
<p><b>Pro Tip: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use tools like </span><a href="https://markuphero.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markup Hero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to quickly snap screenshots and add annotations like arrows, highlights, callouts, boxes, and more. These types of images are quick to make and can really help explain things that a photo alone can’t do. \</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can even annotate PDFs and Google Docs and generate share links, making the tool as useful for internal communication as it is for customer-focused messaging.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. You should implement CDN</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, CDN is crucial for websites with an international audience. CDN</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a highly distributed platform of servers that will speed up web page content loading time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It decreases the distance between the server and the user. The users worldwide can thus see the same high-quality content without facing speed issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDN is very beneficial for companies and websites with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an international audience. However, if you have a smaller reach, it will be an unnecessary expenditure.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>5. Caching plugin is enough for your website</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A caching plugin can speed up your website if you correctly configure it. It can quickly fix your site if it is underperforming. However, remember that caching a </span><a href="https://www.supermonitoring.com/blog/5-wordpress-plugins-to-speed-up-website/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plugin is the last step in boosting site speed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can optimize WordPress sites on different layers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caching plugins will not fix issues like poor code though they can decrease the effects. Focusing on other aspects to solve other site issues will boost your site’s speed and performance.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>6. Plugins can slow down a website</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress has thousands of plugins that can be downloaded and installed on any WordPress website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about WordPress plugins is they can make your website function in ways you never thought it could. The problem with WordPress plugins is that they can slow down your website to a crawl and cause it to run out of memory. It’s essential to know how well your plugins are performing and what you can do to optimize the performance of your website. Sometimes, such feedback comes because of SEO myths if you only read blogs and don’t dig into the particular scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it’s a big fat myth that plugins slow down your site. The truth is &#8211; only outdated plugins, plugins that are written poorly or in conflict with the settings &#8211; usually slow down your site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid this, make sure to install updated plugins, uninstall plugins that you do not need, and keep reviewing your plugin status timely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take some precautions, there’s no reason you can’t use plugins to boost and streamline the look and functionality of your WordPress site.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>7. Updates can break your WordPress website</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While updating your site, sometimes you may face compatibility issues, and it will even end up breaking your site. However, it should not deter you from updating your site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your website updated will not only boost your site’s performance but strengthen security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While updating, remember to keep backups. You can retrieve your data from your backup in case anything happens, such as a security breach or your site breaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also keep your FTP Logins, cPanel, and Hosting handy. It will help you in restoring your backups in case the need arises.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>8. Your server location is not important</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a good idea to select a server location nearest to your target demographic. Besides, you should inquire your host about your actual server location’s traffic and capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times website owners face downtime or get the message that the site has exceeded traffic capacity. When you use shared servers, your next-door site might be utilizing all the resources that are shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak to your host and find the best answer for the problem.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>9. All WordPress themes are optimized for speed</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress has a plethora of themes. However, you should consider speed when you are picking one. Themes that don’t have good coding will affect loading speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is important to select a theme that is visually appealing, you should also check whether it is optimized for speed. You will have to test until you find a theme that is both visually appealing as well as speed optimized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have chosen a multipurpose theme that comes with a lot of features, ensure to activate only the features that you’ll utilize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider using </span><a href="https://www.multidots.com/wordpress-performance-optimization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress performance optimization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> services to speed up your site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, use a theme that enables extensive customization options. You should also be able to add as many images as you want and wherever you want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re running an e-commerce site or a marketing blog, you might need to add multiple images and screenshots for demonstration purposes. So, it’s essential to have a customizable theme. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>10. WordPress is not cut out for e-commerce</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress not being suitable for e-commerce sites is far from the truth. Yes, there was a time when you could not imagine using WordPress for e-commerce purposes. However, WordPress has developed so many e-commerce plugins and pre-designed themes now that help you set up an e-commerce store with ease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up a fully functional e-commerce site on WordPress is easy if you use plugins like Woocommerce and WP e-commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, you can easily set up and use WordPress for your e-commerce purposes. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress, being the most popular CMS today, has many users worldwide. However, there are so many myths around the CMS that many web owners believe to be true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myths such as you need expensive hosting for increased speed, WordPress is not scalable, you should upload only high-quality resolution, and more should be done away with right away.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing content to audiences has become too technical to make mistakes. There are no do-overs, and there is, most certainly, no room for mistakes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Impact Plus, 36% of SEO experts think headlines and titles are the most important SEO element. Headlines and titles alone contain keywords, a crucial element to search engine optimization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we have established that SEO is important. Every </span><a href="https://www.digitalexpress.agency/seo-services-dubai/local-seo-service-dubai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local SEO service in Dubai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> knows this. But did you know that you might be at a loss if you do not narrow down your SEO with respect to your range?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why it is important to understand the difference between Local and Hyperlocal SEO.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Local Vs Hyperlocal SEO</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rudimentarily, local search engine optimization or local SEO focuses on cities, maybe regions, and tailors its processes accordingly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you are targeting people living in Riyadh or Dubai, you will tailor your keywords to cater to that audience in particular. It is necessary so that you may get the rankings you are looking for. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas hyperlocal SEO is an even narrower approach to reaching out to an audience. Hyperlocal SEO focuses on neighborhoods, streets, even landmarks. This includes a lot more targeting than its local counterpart. </span>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Local SEO</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local SEO is as good as casting a wide net can get. Let’s discuss some of its benefits. </span>

&nbsp;
<h4>Plentiful Visibility</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With local SEO, you and your business can gain a whole lot of visibility. This means that you will be reaching out to exactly the people who are looking for your product, are interested in it, and are being targeted at the right stage – the consideration stage. </span>
<h4>Improvement of Traffic and Search Relevancy</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not utilizing local SEO, this could mean that you are competing for space in the search results with competitors and other businesses. Chances of your business getting unnoticed or passed over are high, but with local SEO, you’ll have potential customers clicking on your website to see your products. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will also help you with search relevancy, and only people who are relevant to your business – in all possible ways – will be led to your website. </span>
<h4>Building Links with Nearby Businesses</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local SEO will help you stay competitive with other local businesses since you will consistently show up on sites. A local business, for example, maybe looking to cross-promote their products with another business within the same locality. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local SEO will help them reach out to you as they will use local SEO to look for businesses like yours. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can mention one another in posts and help each other grow – weird, we know, but that is how it is working. Hence, you can use local SEO to improve business relationships and improve client retention ratio – but this will eventually come down to survival of the fittest. </span>
<h4>Possible Repeat Customers</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local SEO helps you capture a variety of shoppers, even those who are visiting your area from someplace else. This depends upon whether you do something, like providing exceptional services, on their first visit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They will remember you by the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">services </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you provided, and when they next are looking for services like yours, they are bound to come to you. </span>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Benefits of Hyperlocal SEO</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyperlocal SEO is much more beneficial than local SEO. Why? Because the narrowed down your net, the higher the chances are of conversions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are going to be a lot fewer similar businesses in the exact location. Hyperlocal results are always highlighted in Google’s map results. Customers looking for your business can quickly look you up this way. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3>Optimizing Content for Hyperlocal Results</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things that you can do to make this happen. </span>
<h4>1. Show your address on your website</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Show the exact address of your business on your website so that Google and website visitors can easily see where you are located.</span>
<h4>2. Use hyperlocal content on your web pages</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keywords are the cornerstone of successful search engine optimization. In addition to the goods and services that you offer, also include local information in the content of your web pages. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mention nearby landmarks (monuments, stadiums, etc.), refer to events in the neighborhood, and include images of the location. When Google crawls your web pages, it should be clear that your business is closely related to the location. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Include your hyperlocal search terms on your web pages.</span>
<h4>3. Create a Google MyBusiness profile</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a profile for your business on Google MyBusiness. This enables you to tell Google the name of your business, the location of your business, your opening times, and much more. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Add as many details as possible to your Google MyBusiness profile. Upload photos and videos. Google will display them in the search results when people search for your business.</span>
<h4>4. Add structured data markup to your website</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured data markup enables you to make it easy for Google to display your opening times, your business telephone number, etc. When Google crawls your web pages, they will find your local information much quicker with structured data. The Rich Results Creator tool in SEOprofiler helps you to create structured data markup for your code quickly and easily.</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/difference-between-local-and-hyperlocal-seo/">Difference Between Local and Hyperlocal SEO</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is a difficult game to play. On the one hand, you know that a huge investment in marketing is likely to land you a slew of new customers that’ll pay back that investment with a large return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, you have other plates to keep spinning, and it can be difficult to justify directing meager resources towards marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, this guide is all about how to invest small to get big returns in the digital marketing space – saving money but still kicking on and securing more customers online. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. SEO</h3>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s begin with your website. It’s here that you’re able to curate all of your content, your pages, your sitemap, and your calls to action to suit your marketing needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And one of the biggest changes that you can make to your website that costs no extra fee is to boost its SEO ranking, ensuring that more consumers searching for your products or services find your website via Google. SEO can be boosted by:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248302"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and using keywords that Google will spot and link to web users searching for those same words</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add high-quality content, like videos and pictures, which is favored by Google’s algorithm </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your website is linking to other high-quality websites, which shows Google you’re a firm and a website to trust</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, curate backlinks to your website from other reputable websites, which will show you’re trusted around the web</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beginner at SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s worth investing in a short crash course to help you understand the benefits of this approach. It’ll help you generate organic traffic that doesn’t cost a penny.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Social Media</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media came along at just the right time for small businesses or those with a small digital marketing budget. Instead of having to take up arms against the big guns in your industry, you can instead quietly plug your business on social media to those followers and their friends that you’re most interested in reaching. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll do this in two ways: with organic followers (those who find you online) and paid ones (those you target via the advertising mechanisms on social media). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic followers are difficult to amass and usually rely on you having wonderful social media pages that share great content. It’s far easier to gather these followers if you’re a sealife park – if you sell curtains, you’re unlikely to get much traction on social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you are a certain business, a little spending, targeting people you think are likely to be renovating their home, could turn up a huge untapped number of customers for your brand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that different social media platforms charge different prices and that the </span><a href="https://manychat.com/blog/instagram-ads-cost/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram ads cost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be more effective for your brand than advertising on Facebook – especially if you’re targeting a younger audience. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Influencers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the topic of social media, there is a third way to get followers, and that’s by partnering with influencers. Again, this might not work for the curtains business: there are only so many ways to make curtains exciting for a young social media audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, suppose you’re in the cosmetics or apparel business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that case, this is something that you absolutely must try: it can help you boost your reach exponentially if you partner with the right influencers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, firms are targeting medium-sized profiles for promotional purposes. The larger ones charge huge rates with diminishing returns, but those with a few thousand followers are more likely not to be trusted and admired by those on social media and will ask for less cash to promote your products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might even do it for a free sample alone. Just be careful here that you sign a </span><a href="https://blog.sharelov.com/how-to-work-with-influencers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in line with laws and regulations. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Banner Ads</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some businesses for which banner ads are incredibly effective and others for which you’ll find you get very little traction at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, you’ll know instinctively if this form of digital marketing is for you. But if you don’t, here’s an example of what works and what doesn’t:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you sell unique protein shakes and your banner ad is on a workout website, it’s going to get clicks, and it’ll certainly secure sales</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you sell the same product, but your banner ad is on more general lifestyle blogs, you’re unlikely to get any interest</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you sell a product that people don’t tend to buy on a whim – like those aforementioned curtains – you’ll probably not fare well with banner ads</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that banner ad are seen as annoying by most web users, so if you engage in this form of advertising, you need to be sure that users will take </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/03/02/banner-ads-examples"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an active interest </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in what’s being advertised. If they don’t, you’ll just be another annoying pop-up. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Video Marketing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, this is one of the forms of marketing that continues to skyrocket in popularity as more and more web users turn to video content as their favored way of consuming information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube is the perfect platform in this respect, as you can be found via multiple channels, and you’ll be able to promote your video, if you wish, to target certain users with certain viewing habits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue with making a video that hits home with consumers is that you’ll need it to be high quality, and producing a high-quality video takes time and resources – and a hefty investment of cash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if this video is something that’ll show off your brand for years to come, it may well be worth that initial investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos that show off something unique and exciting about a product or company work especially well. Think of those videos of </span><a href="https://insiderpaper.com/video-robot-dog-public-street/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robotic dogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that do the rounds on social media: millions if not billions of people are aware of the lab that produced them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the power of a great marketing video: people share it far and wide, with huge promotional potential for your brand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is a difficult priority to balance with the rest of your business objectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you take account of the methods outlined here, you should be able to attract new customers to your brand without breaking the bank as we head towards 2022 and a year of new opportunities for your business. </span></p>

			<p>How do you know you’re doing things right when it comes to your business? Well, apart from the numbers at the end of each month’s financial report, you may also want to pay a bit more attention to your online presence.</p>
<p>According to Investopedia, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp">90% of startups</a> doing amazing things end up going bust within ten years of their founding. Now that’s not just worrying. It also brings forth existential questions such as: are business ventures even worth investing in?</p>
<p>The short answer is a <b>resounding yes</b>. However, if you want to make your startup into a business that’ll keep you fed, clothed, and with a roof over your head for years to come, you’re going to need more than great products and a stellar business strategy. SEO is going to be one of those essential tactics for success.</p>
<p>Without further ado, the following are the steps you need to take if you want to make it in today’s market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Understanding the Difference Between Paid and Organic Traffic</h3>
<p>If you look at the definition of SEO, you’ll find that it stands for <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-exactly-does-seo-help-in-digital-marketing/">Search Engine Optimization</a>. Essentially, the term denotes a set of activities that are implemented to drive traffic to your website. Ideally, you don’t just want <b>more</b> traffic, but you also want to get the <b>right</b> traffic.</p>
<p>Let’s put it this way: you don’t want just anyone coming to your website, then clicking away in under ten seconds after they’ve realized it’s not the right thing for them. You want your target audience to land and, more importantly, stick around.</p>
<p>Another thing you need to understand about SEO, that is, organic traffic, is that it isn’t a replacement for other marketing strategies. Yes, getting to the top of a SERP is the goal. However, unless you’ve got years to wait, you’ll need to spend money on paid advertising.</p>
<p>But, while the bad news is that you do need a padded budget to get your startup off the ground, there’s good news as well. And that is, you can <a href="https://zerogravitymarketing.com/increase-your-organic-traffic-with-ppc/">use both paid and free traffic data</a> to continually improve your advertising strategies, ultimately ensuring the biggest bang for your buck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Research &amp; Define</h3>
<p>So, now that you understand that SEO isn’t an all-in-one solution but rather one part of your marketing strategy, it’s time to start getting more of that sweet free traffic.</p>
<p>Just like with any other business undertaking, you’ll need to start with research. To be able to promote, represent, and place your brand as the answer to your target audience’s needs, you need to have a strong understanding of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Your market and niche</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b>Having <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide">insightful knowledge about your industry</a> is a key element to making the right business decisions for your brand. Ultimately, you need to know the exact type of products and services available currently, the products that consumers want but that aren’t available, the challenges within the industry, as well as the opportunities your competition still hasn’t realized.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Your competitors</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b>Once you’ve got a solid understanding of the state of things in your niche, you’ll want to analyze the brands you’ll be going up against. What do they do? Are they good at it? What marketing strategies do they use? <a href="https://startupresources.io/collection/seo/">SEO tools</a> like Ahrefs or SEMrush will help you get to the bottom of what they’re doing and give you clear guidelines on possible SEO strategies. You will also want to identify the instances where they can improve. And most importantly, identify the aspects of business where you can do a better job answering consumer needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Your target audience</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the last preparatory phase in your research is going to be a deep dive into the needs, motivations, and characteristics of your target audience. You’ll need to create buyer personas, identify their behaviors, challenges, and motivators. Ultimately, making a startup successful isn’t about millions of one-time sales but rather about creating a loyal audience who’ll be happy to recommend your products to the people in their social circle.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got these three basics covered, you’ll be well on your way to taking all the right steps to success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Study User Intent &amp; the Sales Funnel</h3>
<p>Once you know what you’re up against, it’s time to set some goals. But how exactly do you do that with SEO?</p>
<p>Well, to create a plan of action for getting organic traffic to your website, you’ll need to take into consideration the fact that not all of your potential customers are the same. In fact, if you look at the sales funnel, you’ll find that there are three main sections of the buyer journey:</p>
<ol>
<li>Awareness</li>
<li aria-level="1">Consideration</li>
<li aria-level="1">Purchase</li>
</ol>
<p>With this in mind, it’s quite important to set goals for each stage of the funnel, taking the necessary steps to get people from all these stages of the buyer journey to visit your website.</p>
<p>In the <b>awareness stage</b>, your users are still in the research phase. Perhaps they have a problem they require a solution to. Or, they might be looking for ways to do a thing on their own.</p>
<p>Whichever the case, their searches are bound to be informational. They’ll be using broad search terms and looking for highly informative content. In SEO terms, your goal in catering to the awareness stage should be <b>providing educational content</b>, preferably free of charge. Create insightful resources, blog posts, videos, and ebooks (which can be gated), and optimize these pages with <a href="https://digiperform.com/on-page-seo-vs-off-page-seo-which-is-more-important/">on-page SEO</a>.</p>
<p>In the <b>consideration stage</b>, your potential customers will already have a basic understanding of the topic. They will be looking at product/service options, with the ultimate goal of making a purchase.</p>
<p>When it comes to SEO for these consumers, you will want to aim for two things. Firstly, they need to come to your landing page. You’ll achieve this by optimizing your pages and distributing your content in the right way.</p>
<p>Secondly, you’ll want to ensure that the landing page is designed to convince. Basically, you want to show your visitors that your brand is the perfect answer to their needs. Ideally, they should be compelled to convert right away, either by signing up for a free trial, joining your mailing list, or contacting your sales team.</p>
<p>The last level of the sales funnel, the <b>purchase stage,</b> is where the consumer will already know that they want to buy from you. Here, you will want to minimize the number of steps it takes for a potential customer to become a buyer. If you are an eCommerce business, you will ideally get them straight from the SERP to the product page. Otherwise, you will want to give them clear <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/local-seo/">directions to your physical location</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Identify Keywords</h3>
<p>Once you have a clear division between your audience segments, your hands-on SEO work can begin. Again, you’ll have to do research, but being diligent about completing this step will ensure that your marketing strategies (free and paid) yield the desired results.</p>
<p>Most business owners know about the concept of keywords, yet it’s surprising how few of them truly understand the importance of using search terms in the right way. The standard course of action for businesses is often to only target ‘seed’ keywords. These are one or two-word terms that are related to their industry/niche.</p>
<p>But, the thing is, they’re unlikely to be enough to get you the results you need. The first reason for this is that there’s too much competition for these terms. The second is that your audience is unlikely to search for something like ‘fitness’ if they’re looking for a local gym that offers a Zumba class.</p>
<p>With this in mind, you will need to dedicate a fair amount of time to do keyword research properly. Here is a short step-by-step guide on how to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Identify the correct seed words for your industry. Try to think of as many as possible so that you have the highest chances of targeting relevant search terms that’ll get potential customers to you.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Enter your seed keywords into a free tool like <a href="https://ads.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner">Google Keyword Planner</a>. Or, if you’ve got the budget, invest in a solution like <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">Semrush</a>, <a href="https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer">Ahrefs</a>, or <a href="https://moz.com/">Moz</a>. Here, you will be looking to collect as many relevant phrases as possible. Pay equal attention to short and long-tail keywords, and don’t forget about questions either. All of these will come in handy once it’s time to start producing your content.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Study your competitors. What search terms do they rank high for? What topics do they cover on their website? Is there anything they’re doing that you still aren’t?</li>
<li aria-level="1">Move away from search engines and take a deep dive into more in-depth resources. Look at topics on websites like <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>. Moreover, visit a few industry-oriented forums to see what people are asking/discussing.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Finally, study the keywords you came up with. What’s their search volume, traffic potential, difficulty, and CPC? Moreover, look at how they rank per location, as well as if there are any seasonal fluctuations in popularity. All of this data will come in handy in determining your content marketing strategy, as it’ll give you guidelines on how to invest your energy to get the best possible results out of your efforts.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Create &amp; Distribute Content</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve done your share of research, you can start working on your data-driven content marketing strategy. Seeing that you have a strong understanding of your niche, audience, and keywords that will get you to the top of SERPs, you will want to get started with producing high-quality content for your website and social media channels.</p>
<p>If you plan on your main content marketing activity relying on your blog, pay attention to on-page optimization. Namely, make sure that your URLs, page titles, headings, and meta descriptions all include your keywords. If your website runs on WordPress, you can use a plugin such as <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast</a> that’ll check all of these elements for you.</p>
<p>Of course, you shouldn’t just stuff an article with keywords, hoping that search engines will pick up on your pages. Instead, aim to produce blog posts that will answer consumer questions and show them that you’re a trustworthy source of information in your industry.</p>
<p>It’s also advisable to pay attention to the quality of the copy you write, minding both grammatical correctness and readability. Free tools like <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> and <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a> will help meet your goals, but it’s also not a bad idea to hire a professional writer.</p>
<p>Of course, the work doesn’t end once you’ve hit publish. To get the best possible results, you will also need to share your content with as many people as possible. To achieve this, do regular social shares, not shying away from <a href="https://buffer.com/library/the-case-for-reposting-content/">reposting articles that perform well</a>. Moreover, try to get as many <a href="https://digiperform.com/6-inbound-marketing-strategies-to-get-organic-backlinks/">high-quality backlinks</a> from authority sites so that your own website’s rankings improve.</p>
<p>Other strategies to implement include guest posts, podcast interviews, influencer marketing on YouTube, and any other method that’ll get your branded content in front of a wide audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Don’t Forget About Technical SEO</h3>
<p>The last step to success for startups relies on the <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-10-evergreen-seo-practices-that-everyone-should-follow-for-website-ranking/">technical aspects of SEO</a>.</p>
<p>As you probably know, website performance, and consequently ranking, depends on a variety of factors. These include domain name, loading speed, mobile optimization, safety protocols, regular updates, etc. You can refer to Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/webmaster-guidelines">Webmaster Guidelines</a> on a list of Dos and Don’ts for your website, but, generally, investing in excellent UX will take care of all the possible issues of technical SEO.</p>
<p>Of course, if there’s an element you’re not sure about, it’s best to consult with a professional SEO service. Alternatively, you can take the DIY route. If that’s your choice, you’ll need to do a thorough analysis of your site’s performance with a tool like <a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a>. Furthermore, you might <a href="https://moz.com/blog/seo-split-testing-a-b-test-changes-google">benefit from testing practices</a> to identify the small changes you can make to improve usability.</p>
<p>In the end, your goal should be to turn your business into a valuable resource to your potential customers, that is, a go-to address for everything related to your niche.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Despite its seemingly intimidating nature, SEO is an investment well worth making. Especially for startup owners who need to get their business off the ground. Fortunately, however, search engine optimization is not an impossible task, and you can even take the DIY route.</p>
<p>Whether you’re doing things on your own or hiring a professional, the backbone of your SEO strategy needs to be thorough research. Pair it with a passion for your subject, value to your customers, and a website with great UX, and you’ll be on your way to success. Even with a shoestring budget.</p>

			<p>Look at any of the factors that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210116084001/https://www.supermonitoring.com/blog/keyword-rank-tracking-how-to-and-tools/">determine Google Search results</a>.  One of the best ways to land on the top results pages is through correct search engine optimization. You will find marketers working hard to learn the latest techniques.</p>
<p>They will also use the best tools available to get ahead of the competition. In our article, we will show you 6 reasons why proxies are essential for your SEO business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why You Need Proxies for Your SEO Business</h3>
<p>It is important to start with a good understanding of proxies. The simplest way to define a proxy is a gateway between you and remote servers. The proxy resembles an online computer that has its distinct IP address. It becomes the middleman that sieves content to and from your site.</p>
<p>Proxies also play other critical roles, such as data encryption. It makes it harder for hackers to find areas of vulnerability. Proxies improve page loading speeds by controlling the amount of traffic. It does this for those coming in or going out. It, therefore, limits the amount of bandwidth you use.</p>
<p>Another important use of proxies is to hide your IP address. Some will distort or shield your IP. In this way, you get anonymity and privacy while online. You can access content that will not be available due to geographical restrictions. Proxies help bypass firewalls or geo-blocking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How Proxies Help With Search Engine Optimization</h3>
<p>From the above, it is clear that proxies play a very significant role.  But do you know that they are crucial in SEO?  Here is how.</p>
<h4>1. The Connection between Proxies and Page Loading Speeds</h4>
<p>Google will penalize any website that has Slow-Loading Pages. You get poor rankings on the search engines. it will impact your visibility online. A proxy can increase your page loading speeds by:-</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Caching data so that the requests load faster</li>
<li aria-level="1">Monitoring and compressing the amount of traffic. You get to save on bandwidth</li>
<li aria-level="1">Search engines look poorly upon websites with slow-loading pages. You will notice that websites that appear on the first results page load very quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h4>2. You Get To Know What Your Competitors Are Up To</h4>
<p>Standard business practice is to pay attention to what your competitors are doing. You, however, do not want to announce your activities. Inasmuch as it is an open business secret, you do not want to make it too obvious that you are checking them out.</p>
<p>If it is any consolation, they are probably doing the same to your website, right this very moment. The best way to hide any of your activities is to use the SEO proxy. It gives you anonymity while allowing you to collect valuable competitor information.  You can then use the data to improve upon whatever it is you’re doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Data-Analysis with Proxies</h4>
<p>Every business decision you make depends on data analysis. It pays to have the right data mining techniques in place to get the best results. With the market constantly evolving, you must keep up with information sources. Yet, some may not be accessible due to content restrictions.</p>
<p>The most common is data restriction based on geographic location. With the right proxy bypassing such restrictions is easy. You get access to content that you can help to improve your SEO.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4>4. Proxies Help With Managing Social Media Platforms</h4>
<p>Social media platforms have opened so many possibilities. You get access to a broad audience base.  With the right targeting or messaging, you can convert them into loyal customers. It could explain why companies will have many accounts running at the same time. You use these platforms for communicating with your customers or potential clients.</p>
<p>Due to the amount of information going out, different websites have different algorithms. Too much content coming in from one particular place may end up looking spammy. One countermeasure you can implement is to block your IP address. If you use a proxy, you can prevent this from happening.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210116084001/https://blazingseollc.com/blog/using-rotating-proxies-get-traffic/"> Rotating proxies</a>, will, for example, use a unique IP address every time it sends out traffic. By using different IP addresses, you maintain your anonymity.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4>5. Use of Proxies for Quality Backlinks</h4>
<p>One of the strongest SEO techniques you have at your disposal is through backlinks. A backlink on the right platform will help increase your presence. The search engines are, however, suspicious of too many backlinks from one site.</p>
<p>Using proxies ensures that you hide your location. Rotating proxies will generate a new IP address for every backlink. Search engines will not determine exactly where they are coming from. In this way, you continue to build an online presence. You do it without attracting any search engines’ penalties.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h4>6. Using Proxies to Track the Performance of Your Website</h4>
<p>You must have measurable metrics for whatever SEO practices you implement.  It helps to know what is working and what may need changing. You must monitor the amount of traffic and the kind of content they interact with on your site.</p>
<p>Proxies allow for the private management of such information. You also get to compare yourself against competitors. You get excellent information that you can use to improve your business.</p>
<p>With web scraping proxies, you will get to know what your audiences are searching for. You get information on keywords and can collect relevant information from specific sites. You can easily get to build an email list because you get access to customer contacts. Targeting with the right messaging becomes so much easier with proper segmentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>We have looked at six reasons why proxies are essential for your business. By hiding your IP address, you get anonymity and privacy. You can collect data about the market or your competitors. You do it without them knowing what you are up to.</p>
<p>You get to track the performance of your site. You also increase page loading speeds, which all contribute to a higher page ranking. Continue to monitor the performance of your website.  In this way, you can make the appropriate SEO changes for better rankings.</p>

			<p>Everyone wants more SEO traffic, and ranking in search-driven results is one of the strongest ways to grow your site’s authority online. Actually getting your site to show up in search engine results pages is another story entirely.</p>
<p>The key to optimizing your search prevalence is to not only consider what keywords your target audience uses but also the intent of each search. Everyone online is looking to find out something, whether it’s the location of a local business or a how-to guide.</p>
<p>By taking your audience’s intent into account, you’ll be able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210105092648/https://digiperform.com/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-seo-marketing/">strengthen your SEO</a> by reaching potential customers exactly where they’re at through high-ranking, valuable content.</p>
<h4>Tailor Your Message to Your Audience’s Purpose</h4>
<p>There are different types of intent that people have online, and each one affects the type of content you produce and how its presented. The four major types of searches people conduct are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Informational</b>: they want to learn something.</li>
<li><b>Commercial</b>: they are considering making a purchase and want to learn more about their options, e.g. “the top smart speakers of 2020.”</li>
<li><b>Navigational</b>: they’re looking for something, e.g. typing in Macy’s to be directed to the Macy’s store website.</li>
<li><b>Transactional</b>: they want to buy something and are looking for a specific type of product.</li>
</ul>
<p>By concentrating on what your target audience actually hopes to achieve, you’ll be able to optimize your keyword strategy with more direct, influential keywords.</p>
<p>Intent SEO allows you to grow your business’s revenue and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210105092648/https://granwehr.com/case-studies">consistently outrank the competition</a>; your content will feel more deliberate, accurate, and aligned with consumers’ needs.</p>
<h4>Optimize Your Pages for Intent Searches</h4>
<p>All of your products on the same page can result in lower results. While you may allow customers to browse your collective wares, there should also be individual pages designed to help search engines find your site more easily.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you sell fitness equipment online. While it might be useful to have everything available in one place, it could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210105092648/https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/04/10/23-proven-ways-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website/">boost your search traffic</a> tremendously if you started to break up content into pages that are optimized for keywords like “the best home treadmills” or “how to build a home gym.”</p>
<p>It’s possible to optimize a site for multiple types of search intent, which allows you to meet buyers at different stages of the sales funnel. Depending on where they are in the pipeline, you can produce content that provides a solution and encourages them to take the next step in the buyer’s journey.</p>
<h4>Use Surveys to Improve Your Keywords and Meta Data</h4>
<p>The best way to learn what your audience thinks is to ask them directly. When someone makes a purchase or signs up for an email list, send a short survey asking them how they found your site and what keywords they used.</p>
<p>You can even make an optional pop-up survey that prompts users to fill you in on how they found you and what they were looking for. If you ever find that it’s difficult to get viewers to participate, consider incentivizing your on-site surveys.</p>
<p>For example, a pop-up might ask viewers to answer a few short questions in order to receive a discount code or free downloadable based on the information they’ve searched.</p>
<p>After you have a better understanding of what searches brought users to your site, you can refine your on-page and meta SEO to improve your ranking.</p>
