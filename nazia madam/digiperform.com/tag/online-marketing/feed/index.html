										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Hello Readers!</strong></em>
<em><strong>Welcome to Digital Marketing News by Digiperform!</strong></em>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Online marketing is a vast industry that keeps on evolving. It’s not easy to keep a track on each and every update. Therefore it’s our obligation to keep you updated about the latest happenings and trends through our digital marketing news section. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s out the latest updates of this week. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>
<h2><b>Update 1: Snapchat has hired former CMO of Time Warner’s &#8211; Kristen O’Hara</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently Snapchat has appointed former CMO of Timer Warner’s as its new Vice President of US Global Business Solutions. O’Hara will oversee the company’s US-based sales leaders and directly report to Snap Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-18472 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/KristenOHara.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="356" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The motive to hire Kristen to oversee sales leaders as well as their relation to building advertisers and helping marketers on the platform to drive bigger results via the Snapchat platform.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While creating a channel between Snap’s chief strategy officer and the Business Solutions group, Kristen will be responsible for the East Coast, West Coast, and Central Business Solutions teams.    </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kristen knows what the top CMOs want because she was one of them herself. Her experience working with us as a client, invaluable insights as a member of our Partner Council, and track record as an agency and marketing leader will help us to better serve our partners,” says Khan.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Snapchat, O’Hara led Time Warner’s marketing team behind the $100 million deal with Snapchat to create shows and ads. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Snapchat is a platform that offers marketers an unmatched combination of authenticity, creativity, and scale. I’m excited to help brands unlock the true power of the platform to drive their business,” says O’Hara.</span>
O’Hara’s official start date is today, September 4. She will be located in Snap’s New York City office.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wish you a great luck for the role Kristen!</span>
<h2><b>Update 2: Facebook launched new Flight Ads to target users searching for flights. </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/helping-travelers-book-their-next-flight-with-flight-ads-on-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flight Ads</a> (previously known as Dynamic Ads) recently launched by Facebook for travelers who look for the flight on travel sites. These new ads will let airlines and airfare apps go beyond simple remarketing targeting and tactics.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with that Flight Ads will allow airlines and airfare apps to target their ads based on a user’s visits to flight-related Facebook Pages, websites and apps outside of the advertiser’s web properties and Facebook Page.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the limited number of advertisers are allowed by Facebook to try out this new feature including Air France and Hopper, an airfare app. After trying this new feature, Air France experienced sudden 66 percent drop in costs per search where ads drove to target the search volume to its website. On the hand, Hopper examined the drop in install costs and a great lift in the engagement rates. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has confirmed that the Flight Ads will be available globally to all advertisers in the coming weeks across its platform, Instagram and its Audience Network.</span>
<h2><b>Update 3: YouTube has stopped accepting new sign-ups for the video and production service</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube is retiring its <a href="https://director.youtube.com/u/0/onsite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Director Onsite Services</a> as of October 31 that was first launched in June 2015. From now, YouTube even has stopped accepting new applications for video ad production that been expanded to more than 170 US cities in March of this year.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Director onsite program, companies that committed to spending at least $350 on YouTube via Google AdWords would have access to professionals who would script, shoot and edit a 30-second video ad at no charge to the advertiser.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A YouTube spokesperson sent the following statement on the decision to end the service:</span>
<em>We care deeply about helping all businesses create and share their stories with the world on YouTube, and we are working hard to build scalable solutions to continue helping them do that.”</em>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of Director onsite, YouTube is recommending advertisers to check out its YouTube Playbook for Small Business and third-party services as alternative resources. According to a YouTube spokesperson, Youtube has been rolling out tools and features focussing on SMBs to do more video ads this year. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This new announcement would help advertisers to focus on building on video ad metrics and tools for creators which would in return provide the ability to live stream broadcasts from a desktop. This would definitely give creators more ways to monetize their content. </span>
<h2><b>Update 4: Twitter launched Audio Podcast feature for its iOS and Periscope users. </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Twitter launched a new </span><b>audio-only broadcast feature</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its iOS users and Periscope. As per the platform, the user has been requesting to provide an option to broadcast without showing their surroundings. The update also comes at a time when audio podcasts are becoming more popular as a medium for both broadcasters and marketers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the spokesperson, Now, in addition to “</span><b>Go Live</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, there is an option to click </span><b>“Enable Audio Broadcast Only”.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After recording an audio broadcast, users can choose to share, save or delete it. We’re launching audio-only broadcasting, so your followers can hear, but not see you.</span>

<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Update 5: Facebook renames Canvas Ads to Instant Experience ads</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has recently renamed Canvas Ads to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/bring-brands-and-products-to-life-with-instant-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Instant Experience Ads</strong></a> giving users building out pixel capabilities around the newly named ad product. These ads can be used in retargeting campaigns. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Instant Experience Ads will now automatically attached to a Facebook pixel which makes it possible for advertisers to use Pixel on their website. This update will help to re-engage with site visitors that interacted with the ads on Facebook. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform is allowing advertisers to embed third-party pixels in their newly named ads to track campaign performance and compare against other campaigns using their choice of respective analytic tools. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also introducing new ways for businesses to understand their customers’ progression from seeing an Instant Experience to completing a purchase, and opening new opportunities for businesses to re-engage with those customers,” writes Facebook on its business blog.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The new format includes a new Instant Form template that makes easier for users to engage with the ad as well as submit their contact information. This template is in addition to the four templates already available: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instant Storefront </span></li>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the sizzling personalities who has mesmerized the country through his perfect plans. From Digital India to Skill India, each mission has proved his only motto to help India to be recognized as one of the top developed countries in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of his mainstreaming programs &#8211; </span><b>Digital India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; has aimed at inclusive growth in areas of network connectivity, electronic services, products, manufacturing and job opportunities, etc. Even, the Government of India has embarked on an ambitious program to bridge India&#8217;s digital platform, connect thousands of villages to the Internet and create millions of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital India is the first step that is aimed at transforming the country into a digitally empowered society and a knowledge economy. With the enforcement of Digital India Initiative, India’s internet population has crossed over 465 million and our country has been experiencing rapid strides of progress with an evolving payments landscape, universal access to mobile connectivity, online Aadhar card-linking, Public Internet Access Programme, online ordering, digital jobs and many more internet innovations.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds7OgI5RcKA" width="820" height="344" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second step, </span><b>‘Skill India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ which is supposed to be a multi-skill programme that brings hope for the youth. This fulfills the real agenda to create opportunities, space, and scope for the development of the talents of the Indian youth and to develop more of those sectors which have already been put under skill development for the last so many years and also to identify new sectors for skill development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When Prime Minister Launches SKILL INDIA on the Occasion of World Youth Skills Day, 18,000 plus ITI graduating students received job offer letters on the occasion of World Youth Skills Day where Government sets the target to provide skill training to 40.02 crore people by 2022.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about Indian Economy, India is expected to emerge as one of the leading economies in the World and likely to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025 where the major impetus is being given to strengthening the backbone of our economy by the SME sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of SMEs which is estimated to be at 42.50 million (registered and non-registered together) which will employ about 106 million which is 40% of India’s total workforce. Comprehending the significance of the SME sector vis-a-vis lending numbers to the job market, contribution to GDP and fostering entrepreneurship and innovation, getting skilled under Skilled India Initiative can work as a wonder in all the parameters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the same advancements, the akin learning initiative can aim at bringing the huge gap that exists between the business’ digital skill needs and the availability of professionally trained fresh talents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Prime Minister has launched Nasscom&#8217;s platform &#8211; </span><b>FutureSkills</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; for skill development in eight varied technologies through Video Conference during the inaugural session of the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT)-2018, especially targeting to the youth of our country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, at Modi Ji addressed a State Level Youth Convention at Tumakuru, Karnataka, via video conference, on the theme – </span><b><i>Youth Power: A vision for New India</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He says, he tries his best to meet youth as much as possible, to understand their hopes and aspirations, and work accordingly. He completely believes in the fact that youth are the true pillars of Modern India &#8211; Developed India.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJBAiq2wYcU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why PM Encourages youth for skill development?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the changing world scenario with regard to industry and the job market, there is now an overpowering need for skilled workers degrees. India is relatively young as a nation with around 28 million youth population being added every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 50 percent of its population is below the age of 25 and more than 65 percent are aged below 35. In 2017, The Indian Finance Minister presented his Budget Speech in the Parliament keeping youth engagement as a major working area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education and Skills Development continue to be a development priority and the Finance Ministry has amply provisioned for existing initiatives to be scaled up and newer initiatives to also be launched. The Budget 2017 brings in much more focus on Job creation and Skills Development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because our Govt believes that more we give importance to skill development, the more competent will be our youth as they are the active partners in nation’s development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15211 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-05-at-6.38.50-PM-300x107.png" alt="" width="751" height="268" /></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Digitalization, the Govt claims to skill and up-skill about two million technology professionals and skill another two million potential employees and students over the next few years. The platform offers skilling and upskilling are Digital Marketing (Internet of Things), Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual reality, robotic process automation, big data analytics, 3D printing, cloud computing and social and mobile. With the advent of new technologies, skilling of young professionals is critical.</span></p>
<p>Why is it important to get skills? How can you work to enhance your skills?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill-Based Jobs: About 90 percent of employment opportunities require skills. Only 20 percent of our graduates get employed. The rest are unable to get suitable employment due to the lack of employable skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the present context of globalization, the demand for skilled and multi-skilled workers has increased. This major factor has even encouraged top big companies to do something called <em><strong>Skilled Based Hiring</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to be the part of this developing Digital India, you should enhance your skills according to it. With over 84% 4G network availability, India has emerged as the strong and high potential country in terms of Digitalization and has been constantly on the parallel path to break all the barriers in online marketing. </span></p>
