<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 1: How Does The Ministry of Food Processing (Govt. Of India) spread awareness about World Food India through social media platforms?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries which is a ministry of the Government of India was looking for various ways to promote and spread awareness about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbMqyuwYelJ2ZJaj340StQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbMqyuwYelJ2ZJaj340StQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food India</a>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ministry wanted to promote India as the world’s food factory. They desperately needed a way out where they could interact and raise not only awareness about the same but to educate Indians on how India is the largest producer of food and food products, suffers from an acute shortage of food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, yet 40% of its food production is wasted annually. Therefore, the country especially the youth needed an awakening regarding the same and World Food Day was the ideal time to start it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meantime, The Ministry analyzed that youth is highly approachable on social media platforms, and therefore, they need to look out for innovative digital marketing case studies to reach them directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the same, they hired a <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-100-digital-marketing-agencies-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing agency</a> that designed a creative marketing strategy that talked about food wastage and how to tackle it. The agency targeted the audience with creative posts and engaging campaigns with hashtags.     </span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 4: How KFC India Boosted its Social Media Presence with campaigns like ‘Design your own bucket’, ‘Radio KFC RJ Hunt, and ‘Currycature’</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is the best platform when it comes to boosting your online presence and increasing the sale of products within the country. The same has been well followed by KFC which is a famous global restaurant chain brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s the number one restaurant brand on social media in India. KFC tried many campaigns to increase its <a href="https://digiperform.com/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-increase-your-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online presence on social media platforms</a> for brand awareness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KFC had launched very famous campaigns like </span><b><i>Radio KFC RK Hunt</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>Design Your Own Bucket campaign,</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b><i>Currycature</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to target the youth audience by involving mobile apps. These campaigns helped them to develop their brand awareness as well as increased engagement.</span></p>
<p><b>How?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they started </span><b><i>Radio KFC RJ Hunt</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Campaign, 3000 people from around 30 Indian cities participated in the competition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39059 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc1.png" alt="RJ Audition" width="477" height="519" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc1.png 580w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc1-276x300.png 276w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Especially newcomers wanted to try their hands over this hunt and decided to take part to collaborate with the famous brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/kfc-india-launches-its-first-ever-digital-only-campaign-211783491.html">“</a></span><b><i>Design Your Own Bucket</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” campaign was another social media marketing strategy where the participants were asked to create their own creative KFC buckets. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 5500 entries took place in total where the participants came up with their colorful KFC buckets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, they have also introduced bucket entries with Sachin&#8217;s picture on the KFC bucket on the day when he retired. Amazing right!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39060 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest.jpeg" alt="KFC contest" width="408" height="400" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest.jpeg 520w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest-300x294.jpeg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest-75x75.jpeg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>

Around 17K Currycatures were made by their fans which gave them a unique experience with the brand.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 5: Tata Sky’s Campaign &#8211; Transferkar Family</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tata Sky is known as a well-known brand with many digital marketing case studies and you can judge by the name, the <a href="https://www.campaignindia.in/video/tata-sky-builds-excitement-for-new-offering-with-the-transferkars/423422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign was solely targeted on families</a>. Obviously, the motto of the campaign was to promote Tata Sky’s product/services called Tata Sky+ Transfer. This new product is used to transfer the recorded content from TV to mobile or tablets.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TATA SKY - Meet Kajal from the Transferkar Family" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEI8nQD0zRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, in each family, everyone has their own preferences when it comes to channels. In families but due to some reason, not everyone watches their favorite shows at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is very common in Indian families where most of the time TV remote is controlled by the head of the family and others just follow his/her favorites. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this purpose, the brand came up with an idea and created the out-of-mind family named </span><b><i>Transferkars</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This product helped family members to transfer their favorite shows on mobiles or tablets and enjoy every bit of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign was a huge success and got viral through social media and TV commercials. Various kind of family-related content was shared during the campaign with discounted offers to the clients. Basically, their understanding of the potential market made the campaign a huge hit.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 6: Paper Boat’s #FloatABoat campaign on social media</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paper Boat is a very known Indian brand of traditional beverages known for drinks which you can commonly prepare at home like aam Panna, Gol Gappa ka Pani, Jamun Kala khatta, and kokum. These kinds of flavors are quite common among Indian families but not everyone can prepare them at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Paper Boat&#8217;s mission states, the purpose of these drinks was to take you back in those memories and float a boot this monsoon. And, the same purpose is very well carried by the team through digital marketing campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They created numerous innovative campaigns that targeted the emotional side of the audience and made them in love with the brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However one of Paper Boat’s campaigns was a huge hit among audiences called </span><a href="https://bestmediainfo.com/2015/07/paper-boat-revives-childhood-memories-with-floataboat-campaign/"><b><i>#FloatABoat</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-39063 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-12.24.jpg" alt="Float A Boat" width="623" height="354" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-12.24.jpg 623w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-12.24-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can get the idea by the name, the company asked people to make a paper boat like they used to make in their childhood days and share it on social media by using the hashtag along with the title of the campaign i.e. </span><a href="https://www.paperboatdrinks.com/hopefloats"><b>#FloatABoat</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and following their social media pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another purpose reviled by the brand is that if someone shared this on any social media, Paper Boat will donate Rs.20 for children’s education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose behind the campaign touched millions of hearts and it was a big success that caused timelines to be jammed with paper boats. You can analyze now how many followers Paper Boat got during the campaign. </span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 7: Nivea India’s ‘Mom’s Touch</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This campaign was dedicated to all the extraordinary and selfless mothers designed especially on Mother’s Day. <a href="https://campaignsoftheworld.com/tv/nivea-moms-touch-the-power-of-care/">Nivea’s Mom’s Touch campaign</a> talked about some extraordinary, selfless stories of the mother from all over the country.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NIVEA Mom’s Touch- Stories of Extraordinary Mothers and Extraordinary Care" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0iSn2alwc8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand asked the audience to share the selfless moment of their mothers by sharing this video over social media platforms. Their marketing strategy also had a beautiful objective to gain viewership. The brand made a promise that by sharing this video on social media the donation from the brand was done for the girls.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 8: KKR &#8211; IPL Team’s Digital Marketing Strategy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not even the IPL team could stay far away from the digital world. Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) is the franchise representing Kolkata in the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 cricket tournament whose co-owner is one of the famous film stars &#8211;  Shahrukh Khan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>As the businesses are growing with each passing day and as the traffic of businesses is increasing, it is important to know the best strategies to promote your business that will catch more audience.</p>
<p>Just like the Subtitles for Movies make it easier for you to understand what is going on in the movie, the marketing strategies are used to make your business grow better and more.</p>
<p>Marketing strategy is basically the things you do, or the steps that you take to promote your business on different platforms and make it known by many people. If you have a business and you want to make it grow on a faster face and want to make it successful then it is important to know the right strategies.</p>
<p>So, for your assistance and to make things easier for you we will state some amazing strategies of marketing that will turn your business from zero to a hundred real quick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Make Your Social Media Game Strong</h4>
<p>You must have heard about how favorable social media is in promoting businesses and how it has the ability to make your business shine brighter. Social media is basically a platform where every other person is looking for something no matter what social status do, they have.</p>
<p>Make your audience attracted to you by putting things on social media that are good for both upper-class and lower-class people.</p>
<p>When you will maintain a balance between your prices and you will make it reachable for everyone then you will only see your customers growing. Always<br />
adapt strategies that can be used by all people and are not bound to some specific class of people.</p>
<p>Social media is a place where customers can directly talk to the sellers and that is what makes social media even more attractive. So, it is important that you make your social media strong and attract more audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Being Connected to Influencers is Very Important</h4>
<p>When we are talking about social media we can forget to talk about how influencers play a very important role in promoting different businesses through social media.</p>
<p>Influencers are the people who are followed by millions of people and when they suggest something there are a lot of people that are impressed by them and look for the things that they buy.</p>
<p>Contact these influencers and ask them to promote your business and pay them their required amount, when these influencers will promote your business you will see how the community around your business grows as well. These influencers are one of the major reasons many businesses work well.</p>
<p>So, if you ever decide to start a business and decide to promote it on social media then do contact influencers to promote your work too. Promoting through influencers definitely works really well for the businesses and you will definitely make a change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Always Respect the Opinions People have for Your Work</h4>
<p>One mistake that most businesses make, which fails miserably is that they are not habitual of taking people’s opinions in the right way. You will see many businesses that will post screenshots of all the good reviews that people give them on their pages but do not post any single thing that is a little against them.</p>
<p>One thing that you need to do is to post honest reviews of what people have to say about your work. Not negative criticism that people do to ruin the businesses but the constructive criticism that builds the right trust.</p>
<p>When your customers will see that you do not just post good comments but you also encourage those who have some sort of constructive criticism for your work then it will build trust in people for you and you will be able to attract more audience.</p>
<p>Always stay true to your customers and that is one of the most important things that will take your work forward quickly and you will be able to make big changes in your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Stay in touch with the customers</h4>
<p>One other thing that will take your business forward is staying in touch with your customers. It is not just talking to them but there are different ways through which you can stay in touch with them. Notice which of your customers are your regular buyers and give them special discounts or give them mini gifts with their every purchase.</p>
<p>When you give special importance to your customers then you gain loyal customers. These people will always bounce back to you when they need something that you are selling.</p>
<p>The other way to stay in touch with your customers is to keep giving them discounts that are beneficial to them. Discounts are one of the most attractive things that are noticed by the customers.</p>
<p>Promote the discounts even if you have to pay for them and you will earn double the amount of what you have already spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. Being Honest is the Key</h4>
<p>Lastly, we would like to mention how important it is to stay honest with whatever you are doing. And by honesty we mean to give what you show. If you post a picture of a beautiful dress on your profile but send something not looking like that, you might be able to trick some people but you will eventually fail.</p>
<p>There will be some people who will buy something from you and get ditched by you but it will not last long and you will eventually face wrath. People will eventually know that you are not honest and you are just spamming them and eventually your work will<br />
fade away.</p>
<p>So, the right way to promote your business and to make it successful is to do it honestly and give it your hundred percent.</p>
<p>These were some of the strategies that you can easily use to attract more audience and will help you earn better and work better. You must have heard about the quote by Frank Ocean that says <em>“work hard in silence and let your success be your noise”.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It seems as though every <a href="https://www.employment.gov.au/growing/i-want-start-my-own-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">online business</span></a> starts after having a bright idea. </span><span class="s1">For the most part, online entrepreneurs have to get a hold of their businesses chunk by chunk. Even worse, once you feel you have seen some progress, things tend to go wrong in the process. </span><span class="s1">This is where the importance of having a strong initial business plan structure comes into play. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What&#8217;s interesting is that this initial stage of creating a business can also be confusing to online entrepreneurs due to all the technicalities of it. That said, if there is one area to focus on, that would be digital marketing. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Digital Marketing for Entrepreneurs has proven to be an effective strategy to focus on because it can save your business if it is set up improperly. </span><span class="s1">To name a few of the benefits that marketing can help an online business in, some of the main benefits include business branding, client acquisition, and long term client retention as well. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another important advantage of marketing with an online business is that it goes away from the old traditional marketing methods that are costly and time-consuming. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Instead, it allows a business to conveniently place themselves in a way that they can benefit from the many people searching online.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online-entrepreneur-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24340 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online-entrepreneur-1.jpg" alt="online entrepreneur (1)" width="493" height="322" /></span></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You may imagine that as a business director, you don&#8217;t have to master everything about advertising advancement methodologies, and you don&#8217;t have to cover all the specialized subtleties. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">However, you&#8217;ll before long discover that regardless of whether you don&#8217;t do everything yourself and you enlist someone to assist you with specific regions of your showcasing advancements. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Despite everything, you have to get familiar with the nuts and bolts of how web-based promoting functions so as to get results </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With this in mind, let&#8217;s go over seven marketing tactics to use as an online entrepreneur.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#1: Stick To One Strategy In The Initial Marketing Phases</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As far as the initial stags of creating a marketing process are concerned, a good tactic to use is to stick to one strategy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">More specifically, sticking to one <a href="https://digiperform.com/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing strategy</a> can prevent your business from overwhelming itself in a way that seems unnatural online. Worth mentioning, online marketing strategies are most effective when they are implemented naturally.</span></p>
<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/240872280057829210/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24341 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/digital-marketing-strategy.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="624" /></a>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#2: Integrate A Customer Relationship Management Tool</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A customer relationship management tool seres the purpose of building a strong relationship with a client as a way to retain them in the long run. This is a proven tactic as it also indirectly improves the quality of your business&#8217; customer service.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Client relationship the executives (CRM) is an innovation for dealing with all your organization&#8217;s connections and co-operations with clients and potential clients. The objective is basic: <em>Improve business connections</em>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A CRM framework encourages organizations to remain associated with clients, streamline forms, and improve gainfulness. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the point when individuals talk about CRM, they are typically alluding to a CRM framework, a device that assists with contact the board, deals the board, efficiency, and that&#8217;s only the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#3: Use Analytics To Measure Marketing performance</b></span></h2>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Another proven marketing tactic that does far more than people realize is using analytics to measure marketing performance. In a broader sense, this tactic will allow you to see what areas of your marketing campaign can be improved. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">However, this tool also helps you find ways to make those improvements in a way that is most efficient to your marketing campaign. As far as how it allows for this, this is done through additional benefits such as faster response times and a convenient streamlined marketing funnel. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Showcasing investigation is the act of estimating, overseeing and breaking down advertising execution to amplify its adequacy and improve the rate of return (ROI). </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Understanding advertising investigation enables advertisers to be progressively effective at their occupations and limit squandered web-promoting dollars.</span></p>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Analytics-.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24342 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Analytics-.png" alt="Google-Analytics-" width="750" height="428" /></a>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of social media where everyone follow known people, one thing is for sure influencers are great for any business. But, to make the best of <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-influencer-marketing-course-the-beginners-guide-to-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">influencer marketing</a>, you will need to think carefully and cautiously about how best you can tap the right resources for your business at the right time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the same, you will need to make sure that all different varieties of niches across a selection of platforms are tested so that you can make the best of all influencers available on the market, whether it is for your Fintech business or any other. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To start with, consider a <strong>video</strong>. </span>
<h4><strong>Why? </strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because a video is considered to be forever unrivaled. It has got a lot of power which you should not ignore when it comes to Fintech Marketing. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motion picture always has been the true form of content. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps the consumer to focus exactly where it is required because they are fully directed by the media.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps the consumers to concentrate on the subject in front of them.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All these things make video one of the most powerful marketing tools. However, you will need to make sure that you create the video content with your product and show how it works. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are n-number of ways in which you can draw the attention of the consumer to your product and also deliver the culture and value of your business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For that matter, you can build on the previous strategy if you want or work with the video-based influencers that operate in a similar field as yours. </span>
<h2><b>Adopt the best marketing style</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, you will have to make sure first that your company is more of a media company rather than a Fintech company to ensure success. This will help you a great deal to generate more awareness of your product by far. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing as it is very hard for any business and in a fin-tech space it is even harder in many ways and all will agree about that.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because financial services are somewhat dull and therefore, you will need to make its marketing aspect more interesting at the least. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, financial technologies can be really boring but that does not mean the marketing style of it should be boring as well.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of interesting and in fact ‘cool’ things that you can do regarding that which will make your Fintech brand and marketing efforts absolutely successful. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few of these so-called cool ways that are often followed by reliable and reputable online sites for money </span><a href="http://www.libertylending.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;"><strong>Mobile-first initiatives:</strong> </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help you to optimize your website for it being used on a mobile phone or any other such mobile devices and make it more fun, joy and interactive for the users to browse through.</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #993300;"><strong>Social media strategy:</strong> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since social media now reigns supreme, it is important for you to define the target audience and provide them with just the thing they want from you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, find out where your target audience hangs out the most and deliver accordingly whether it is Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, or any other social media platform.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Content: </strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For any type of marketing, your content will play the most significant role. You can follow the right <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing</a> for your brand reason. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is, for this reason, you must make sure that you create valuable content that is more engaging and appealing making it become the gateway to hearts of your target audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, there is nothing more important than valuable and insightful content that will educate the users and delight them.</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #993300;"><strong>Branding:</strong> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing more important than branding if you want to make a better and long-lasting impact on your business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that you focus on bold branding even though you are working in a boring industry, Fintech. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not take that to your heart because today all buyers looking to get more engaged with a particular brand before they make their buying decision. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes them feel that their favorite companies understand them and in return, they share their values. </span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #993300;"><strong>Engage with the users:</strong> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should make it a point that you engage more with your users whether it is on your site or on social media, through emails or conversations and chats or any other platform for that matter. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must remember that your customers always need to be recognized as well as catered to. There is nothing more amazing and better for the customers than knowing that the favorite brand listens to them and provides them with the best value, the most dynamic solution, and the most unique user experience.</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #993300;"><strong>Overdeliver:</strong> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that you do not deliver anything that is not expected or wanted by your users. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally in both small and big ways alike you will need to make sure that all your customers, existing ones as well as those potential ones know that you and your company believe in customer-first philosophy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that you do something that is memorable and once you do make sure that you do not forget to share it with the world.</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #993300;"><strong>Channel choice:</strong> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need to choose the right resource as well as the right social media channels for your Fintech marketing purpose. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you post your ads on the right social media channel according to the presence and demographics of your target audience you will be able to reach out to more and more people. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional media, however, is not dead by any means but it will not be able to deliver the same ROI as these channels would, being much more opaque in comparison. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, make sure that you choose the channels that are most cost-effective and are easier to track from a point of view of performance.</span>
<h4><strong>It&#8217;s just the beginning&#8230;&#8230;</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, choose the right influencers to team up with so that you can get to reach to the right customers at the right time. When you use video it will make things much easier when it comes to educating and converting your leads.</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/top-6-effective-digital-marketing-strategies-for-financial-services/">Top 6 Effective Digital Marketing Strategies For Financial Services</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you follow it, and pair your plan with these <a href="https://digiperform.com/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing strategies</a>, you’ll see your traffic, conversions, and sales increasing in no time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s get started.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">1. Content Marketing</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business needs a website, and every website needs a blog. And that means your online shop needs </span><b><i>high-quality content</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that adds value to current and new customers.</span><br />
<b>96% of people that arrive on your website for the first time are not ready to buy.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t mean you can’t give them something to come back to. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to providing great products and services, you should aim to create blog content that informs, educates, and even entertains those that arrive on your website.</span><br />
<i></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure what to write about?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out a tool like</span><a href="https://answerthepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Answer the Public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39392 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.34.37-PM-300x161.png" alt="Answer the questions " width="699" height="376" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.34.37-PM-300x161.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.34.37-PM-1024x549.png 1024w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.34.37-PM-768x412.png 768w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.34.37-PM.png 1217w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After entering the keyword you want to rank for in search results, this free online tool shows you actual Google queries people are typing into the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about this is you can use those questions real people are asking and write about them, so the next time someone asks a similar question, your website pops up in the search results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But remember, selling products online from home is about more than listing products in your online shop and whipping up a few blog posts for people to read.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a good content marketing plan will include things like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating standard web pages like an ‘</span><b><i>About Us</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’ ‘</span><b><i>Contact Us</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’ and checkout pages</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uploading high-resolution product images and optimizing the product descriptions for SEO</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activating payment gateways for customers to use when buying from your online store</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an email list for email campaigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning your blog post publishing schedule</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a strong social media presence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking into the different advertising methods, such as pay-per-click ads, to generate more leads</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing</a> involves promoting your brand to your target audience and convincing people to convert. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a well-thought-out plan as you open up shop will save you lots of time and get you more customers from the start.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">2. Advertising</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of advertising, there are several ways to advertise your online shop and get more people to buy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can send out email campaigns to share promotions,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">run contests on your social media accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an even create banners on your site with timers to create a sense of urgency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, one of the most affordable, easy to do, and effective ways to advertise is pay-per-click advertising. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously known as Google AdWords, </span><a href="https://digiperform.com/google-rebrands-its-advertising-products-google-adwords-is-becoming-google-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Google Ads</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to drive organic traffic to your eCommerce shop by honing in on popular keywords related to what you sell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Google Ads, you choose keywords you want to target and bid on them. The more popular a keyword, the more expensive it will be. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is, you can set maximum bid amounts, so you don’t overspend on your advertising budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone enters a relevant search query into Google, the advertiser that’s targeting the keyword that has the highest bid wins the auction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means an advertisement for their website appears in the search results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your ad wins, and someone clicks on it, you pay the amount you agreed, and the site visitor comes to your site (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and hopefully converts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to good advertising is to target keywords that are competitive enough to drive traffic, but not so competitive they wipe your ad budget out fast.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">3. Use a relevant URL</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to drive people to your eCommerce site from other channels, including organic search results, paid advertisements, and social media, is to have a relevant domain name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you </span><a href="https://www.lcn.com/domain-names" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy a domain name for your eCommerce shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it should reflect what you have to offer your target audience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, after only looking at your site’s URL, people will know whether you have what they’re looking for or not.</span><br />
<i></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure how to pick the right domain name for your business? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out these helpful tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it short and easy to type so people can revisit your site </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target your area if that’s where you want business to come from</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include keywords so people know what you’re all about before arriving on your site</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a popular extension such as .com, .net, or .org</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research the competition so you don’t have to fight with well-established businesses for customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect your domain name by securing it, buying similar and misspelled domain names, and keeping all sensitive domain name information safe</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your domain name is one of the most important elements of your eCommerce site. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is to increase traffic, conversions, and sales, put some thought into the name you choose so your business can grow. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">4. Email Marketing</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above,</span><a href="https://www.infographicportal.com/email-marketing-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">email marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is great for advertising your online shop to subscribers, no matter where they are in the customer journey. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the best part about email marketing is that not only does it offer the highest ROI out of all marketing strategies, but it’s also cost effective too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, if you use MailChimp as your email service provider, you won’t have to pay a dime until you reach more than 2,000 subscribers or 12,000 emails a month.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39396 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.09-PM-300x171.png" alt="" width="672" height="383" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.09-PM-300x171.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.09-PM-768x438.png 768w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.09-PM.png 874w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create emails to send to subscribers, ads for Facebook or Instagram, landing pages for your eCommerce shop, postcards, and even signup forms for your site so people can subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, automate your campaigns to send out based on specific behavior. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, send out a welcome email anytime someone subscribes to your <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-email-marketing-course-chapter-2-how-to-build-email-marketing-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email list</a>, and include a coupon to use in your store to entice them to come back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing is a simple way to stay engaged with those that have shown interest in what you have to offer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a great way to keep in touch with those that never converted while on your site.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">5. Add Testimonials</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">84% of people trust online reviews as much as friends and family. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, big-name retailers like Amazon wouldn’t add customers testimonials to their website if they thought they didn’t make a difference in buyer behavior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39395 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.18-PM-300x194.png" alt="what is email marketing " width="572" height="370" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.18-PM-300x194.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.18-PM-768x497.png 768w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.18-PM.png 862w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need an easy way to ask satisfied customers for their testimonials?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to MailChimp, you can always create an automated email campaign that sends out to people that have made a purchase on your site and ask them for a review.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39397 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.24-PM-300x185.png" alt="email markeitng testimonial" width="595" height="367" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.24-PM-300x185.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.24-PM-768x474.png 768w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-14-at-5.35.24-PM.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for star ratings, personal testimonials, and approval from happy customers to add their names to your website for others to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If people rely on what others are saying about your brand and products before they make a purchase, give the people what they want and show them how satisfied your customers are.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, this is by no means an exhaustive checklist for opening up a successful online shop. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you follow these basics, you’ll build a strong foundation yourself that you can use to grow your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the time to focus on more than web design and product pages on your eCommerce site. While these things are important, people aren’t going to magically appear and buy from you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to put the work in to expose your brand to a broader audience, show people why you’re worth their money and go above and beyond just selling things for a profit.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monica Gandhi, Business Head at Technicians, is a natural “<em>Trusted Advisor</em>” who helps companies to meet their sales and marketing targets. In this post, she has shared the <em><strong>10 Things to Consider Before Going for <a href="http://www.purplesyntax.com/SEO-Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Services</a></strong></em><strong>.</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are looking for the best <a href="https://seoserviceinindia.co.in/">SEO services in India</a> or any other country these factors will support in finding the perfect service for your organization. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a good practice to be followed these days. It is constantly inviting changes in its practice. The changes are simply done to provide a good user experience. Unlike old SEO practices which could be handled with the help of cheap backlinks and heavy keyword density, modern SEO works with a fully integrated strategy. The companies that once completely relied on their in-house Search Engine Optimizer are now out looking for a company that consists of SEO experts. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may require more than one or two SEO experts to deal with increased content demand, good backlinks, and working with Google priorities with complete knowledge of it. Whereas a good such as <a href="https://seoservicescompany.co.in/noida/">SEO company in Noida</a> can help you climb the ladders of success, on the other hand, it’s vice versa can trick you in black hat technique and leave you with less amount of traffic. While hiring a good SEO team, there is no restriction of being an expert, simply keep in mind the above 10 things and you&#8217;ll be successful in gaining a good one for your company.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>1.WHY ARE YOU APPROACHING THE SEO TEAM? WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even an SEO team can have further divisions. What all are your expectations and how would you like the team to work is one of the most important factors. Until and unless the team and you aren’t clear about the goals and procedure, you cannot proceed further. Choose a team, which would provide you: </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Technical SEO</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This team takes care of the code, site design, speed, and all the other metrics which are directly or indirectly linked to the traffic of your site. The technical SEO team ensures good and easy use of the web page to avoid any kind of user inconvenience. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li><b><i>User experience(UX)</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; It revolves around the content. An SEO expert would analyze the customer facets and improve as well as organize the content accordingly.</span></li>
 	<li><b><i>Off-page SEO</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; It means promoting your services via earning links. Strengthening the popularity of your brand is done by the SEO agency.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure while hiring the SEO agency, you confirm these three expectations from it. Also that they have a clear execution strategy ahead. Not only SEO company in Noida takes care of these three needs but explains to you its future plans for your betterment. </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14381" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.36.41-PM-300x134.png" alt="SEO agency" width="708" height="316" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> STRATEGY OF AGENCY TOWARDS YOUR GOALS</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://attrock.com/search-engine-optimization/">SEO services</a> have no universal solution. Every agency has its own ways to manage and work till the desired goals aren’t reached. As your business needs a unique execution approach to stand apart from the crowd. Since your goals are different, you would probably expect your team to work on it and find unique strategies, models, and ideas to uplift your business over the internet. SEO agency would probably cater to your goals, model, deadline, and does its best to exceed your expectations.  </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14382" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.36.50-PM.png" alt="SEO agency noida" width="449" height="438" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>3.TIME DURATION OF EXPECTED RESULTS</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact cannot be denied that <a href="https://digiperform.com/search-engine-optimization-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> takes time to display its results. This doesn’t mean that an SEO agency would set a time frame in front of you. For example, <a href="https://seoservicescompany.co.in/delhi/">SEO services in Delhi</a> take no longer than 6 months to showcase their results. The result is directly linked to the condition of your site. More traffic is directly proportional to good results. If the site is possibly well structured and free of any technical issue, you are more likely to achieve the results faster than you have thought. Question back your SEO agency to know their intentions more clearly at every point in time.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14383" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.01-PM-300x127.png" alt="seo result" width="673" height="285" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> APPROACH TO MOBILE &#8211;</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that your SEO agency has an approach to mobile too. Ever since Mobile has been given birth, with its improved technicalities the importance of it is reaching heights. It is a very good idea to optimize the mobile too for a better and user-friendly platform. SEO service providers have mobile optimization included in it as more than half of customers are made from the mobile approach which surely defines the perks of <a href="https://digiperform.com/what-is-mobile-marketing/">Mobile Marketing</a>.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14384" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.11-PM-300x225.png" alt="mobile seo" width="477" height="358" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> HOW TO CONDUCT KEYWORD RESEARCH-</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, keyword research simply meant to generate relevant keywords from a keyword generator tool. Modern keyword research requires extra effort. It focuses on the user intent. In this, the agency thinks what users possibly might require and what possibilities they could type over the internet to reach that piece of information. SEO agency ensures keyword research and has well-defined methodologies to determine the right keyword for that particular piece of content.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14394" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-2.10.32-PM.png" alt="process of keyword research" width="472" height="324" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> TOOLS TO BE USED &#8211;</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of the tool holds no importance but the reason behind it holds the most. There are certain questions that hold great importance and SEO services in Noida have undoubtedly answered all &#8211; </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are all <a href="https://digiperform.com/latest-digital-marketing-tools/">Digital Marketing Tools</a> being used to monitor and why?</span></li>
 	<li>Type of crawler you use and the reason behind it?</li>
 	<li>What tools are used to conduct keyword research and why?</li>
 	<li>How do you perform competitor analysis?</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your agency has a valid answer to each question stated above. </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14387" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.46-PM-300x161.png" alt="SEO STRATEGY " width="596" height="320" />
<ol start="7">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> IS YOUR SEO STRATEGY COPING UP WITH YOUR OVERALL MARKETING STRATEGY? </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid the companies who choose to perform their tasks in complete isolation. SEO happens along with content marketing, social media marketing, and public relations. SEO company is flexible enough to collaborate with other marketing teams meanwhile. For effective link building, it is important to cope with all other teams as well.</span>
<a href="http://www.networkingvidya.com/on-page-seo-strategies-step-by-step-guide/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14388" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.55-PM-300x169.png" alt="SEO STRATEGY For Marketing" width="591" height="333" /></a>
<ol start="8">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> REPORT ON PROGRESS &#8211; </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO agency provides a sample of the report generation. This is useful to learn the methodologies of the agency you are working with. Beware of the companies who do not cater to your needs, especially when you request them to provide a detailed progress report. Now that you have already shared your goals with them and then they can tell how they can customize your progress report. No matter, SEO report totally depends on the size of reports but in the end, it ought to be detailed and well understood. Bigger companies or shorter projects may require detailed reports.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14389" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.38.05-PM-300x211.png" alt="SEO Report" width="536" height="377" />
<ol start="9">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> HOW TO STAY UP TO DATE IN THE INDUSTRY?</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may definitely require someone who wholeheartedly participates in discussion forums and reads all popular SEO blogs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, whenever you plan a wedding, you list few of your ideas and have expectations to be followed for the occasion.

Similarly, you should plan your business’ marketing strategies followed by complete analysis. To create a meaningful strategy, you need to conduct a deep level of research which is followed by competitors to have an overview of the market trends. Most businesses would rather not take the risk, especially when the information is easily available on the World Wide Web. So why would one create a <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-strategies-explode-business-2018/">digital marketing strategy</a> without a competitor analysis?</span>
<b>What is Competitor Analysis?</b>

Using a competitor analysis develops to create a strategy based on complete evidence, and heading down a right path without failing and working without a cohesive plan.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxgs0jBLaIk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a marketing competitive analysis helps you:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare the topics, tactics, and channels driving market performance for you and your competitors.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncover opportunities to outperform the competition and differentiate your brand.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmark your brand against competitors, industry leaders, and market influencers.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>How to do a Competitive Analysis?</b>
<b><i>Choose the right metrics:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many marketers struggle to identify the right metrics to track their performance. Tracking your audience growth on social media and other channels allows you to determine the increases and decreases in your brand’s digital audience. By benchmarking audience growth against competitors you can spot where competitors are having a greater impact and improving your brand awareness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of marketing channels you could use in a competitive analysis:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earned media</span></li>
</ul>
<b><i>Website Audit:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most obvious part of any Competitor Analysis. At the surface level, it’s simply looking at their site, seeing what works well and what doesn’t. If a competitor has had a new website created that is easier to navigate than yours, then it is the foremost to explain why your conversions have dropped. Simultaneously, if you suddenly get a significant increase in conversions then you should seek out the answer as to why that is. The deeper level of analysis signifies things such as load times, server response times and overall website responsiveness. Ensuring every page of a website is not only responsive to different screen sizes and browsers but also friendly to them.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2herjSjceM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<b><i>Paid Search Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With search audit tools, it’s possible to find a lot of insight into the Paid Search habits of your competitors, estimate their budgets and understand the balance they strike between Paid and Organic Search. Using the same report, it can help to evaluate what keywords are valuable enough that your competitors are willing to pay money to be seen for? This audit can provide insight into what keywords are leading to conversions (sales) for your competitors.</span>
<b><i>Social Media Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As social media content continues to increase as touch points on the path to purchase across many industries, understanding what social channels are driving the most traffic is important. If a competitor is receiving a substantial amount of social traffic from Facebook, one should know what types of content they’re posting and how frequently.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14374" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BuzzSumo-1024x574-300x168.png" alt="Social Media Audit" width="716" height="401" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the vast area where it is difficult to analyze without certain digital marketing tools. On the deeper side of the analysis, you can look at large amounts of data to ascertain levels of engagement of their fan base, whether it appears they are using certain strategies and if there are useful findings such as optimum posting times for your target demographics that you could apply to your social media strategy.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEViF6tTqG4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<b><i>SEO/Keywords Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying Keywords that are common to you and your competitors is key to succeed in this competitive strategy. Unfortunately, there will be times when you simply may not be able to rank for a keyword you want to organically but on the flip side, you can focus on gaining those keywords you already show dominance in. Having a thorough understanding of the Keyword terms targeted by your competitors along with maps of their search traffic will help inform both your own Organic and Paid Search strategy going forward. It is also once again an indicator of how seriously they take their Digital Marketing and the strategies they are employing. The key to strategic insight is the range of data looked at and the depth of the analysis. It is simple to see what Keywords your competitors are ranking for now.</span>
<b><i><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14376" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cc-300x165.jpg" alt="SEO/Keywords Audit" width="691" height="380" /></i></b>
<b><i>Local Presence</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of local search terms such as ‘near-me’ have been well documented but even without them, local searches make up a huge portion of product/service based search terms. Knowing whether your competitors are taking full advantage of all of the Local Directory Listings lets you know where there could be yet more easy wins.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13041" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2.3-300x189.png" alt="Local Presence" width="390" height="246" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of businesses know by now that they should have claimed and completed their Google My Business (used to be Google Places) listings. Surprisingly very, very few business have engaged in any strategy to ensure their reviews are linked to these listings. A comprehensive review of all Local Directories will show where your competitors have left gaps that you can take advantage of in as little as a few minutes.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are many tools such as <em>SimilarWeb, Google Advanced Search Operators, SEMRush, Google Alerts</em> etc that you can utilize to track the performance and digital marketing strategies of your top competitors.</span>
