										<content:encoded><![CDATA[The marketing plays an important role in any business. Whether it’s a B2B (business to business) or B2C (business to consumer), it helps to build the relationship between the customer and clients. In my opinion, <em>marketing is the most important activity in a business as it has a direct effect on sales and profitability.</em> In today’s world, both large and small organizations are competing for the same market in a very most innovative way and only proactive ones have emerged as victors. Today’s global economy has realized the importance of small organizations and increasingly giving them the much-needed support to sustain their growth. As a result, a company’s survival is dependent upon their wise marketing efforts coupled by financial operational among other functions within their structure.
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-13034 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/b2bb2c-300x300.png" alt="b2bb2c" width="441" height="441" />
Generally, in <em>B2B, a marketer focuses on the logic and features of a product</em>. There is little to no personal emotion involved in the purchasing decision. The marketer wants to focus on understanding the organizational buyers and how they operate within the confines of their organization&#8217;s procedures. What&#8217;s their role? What&#8217;s important to them? And so on.
On the contrary in <em>B2C marketing, the marketer wants to focus on the benefits of the product.</em> Their decision is more emotional. Consumers are different in that they demand a variety of distribution channels for convenience, not so with the B2B market. Consumers are less likely to be interested in a lengthy marketing message. They will want you to get right to the point. Consumers don&#8217;t want to work to understand the benefits; instead, they will want you to clearly point out the benefits to them.
ONLINE REVIEWS INFLUENCE CONSUMER BUYING: It has been seen that more than 60% of buying online occurs based on the reviews that are seen online. Companies, therefore, will have to start taking these reviews very seriously.
A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME IS SPENT ON SOCIAL NETWORKS: Social presence is very important, with more than 25% of the time spent online being done so, on social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, etc.
USAGE OF VIDEO CONTENT GOING UP: Customers spend more than 5 hours a day viewing video content online and making buying decisions. The implication that one sees because of this is that companies of today need to agile, with a mobile-friendly website, a strong social media presence or E-commerce capabilities.
CONSUMER TOLERANCE IS REDUCING AT AN ALARMING LEVEL: Consumer wants a response as fast and as clear as possible. It takes merely one viral tweet or post to destroy or build a company’s rapport. Platforms like Quora, Twitter, Facebook, etc. are being used by consumers to share their misfortunes that they had faced with a company. Negativity attracts people and this is human psychology.
CUSTOMERS ARE NOT AFRAID OF EXPERIMENTING NEW THINGS: Gone are those days when people are afraid of using a new product and would use it only when somebody else puts a trust deal on the product. Now, a new product with good features and quality is lauded with applause by our consumers. Experimenting concept prevailed and due to which many companies like OYO, Uber, Ola, etc. came to life.
With these ones can say that the world has changed, so as the way of they behave and learn. The digital era has completely changed every part of lives. The business world is not exempt from this reality. It’s more and more evident that brands must lay down to new paths in their search to connect with their public, and experiential marketing is the key to this. The brands want to give a human touch to their marketing and advertising through digital mediums. The generation is so reluctantly depended on the internet that they want everything just a click away.
In the era of digitalization, still, there are 46% of brands who don’t have a defined digital marketing strategy while 16% do not have a strategy yet integrated into their marketing activity. This seems insane where more than 3.9 billion global internet users are available and businesses are still not able to find out the importance of digital marketing. So let’s discuss what is Digital Marketing? Why is it trending? How has it changed the trends of B2B and B2C marketing? How has digital marketing reframed marketing as H2H, Human to Human? (<a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-helps-put-customers-first/">How Digital Marketing out your customer first?</a>)
