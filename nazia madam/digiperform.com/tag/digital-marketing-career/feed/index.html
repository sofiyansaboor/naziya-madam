<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time I come across queries asking, can a software engineer go for Digital Marketing to have a better career? Is digital marketing can benefit engineers? My answer is YES. The software engineers are already classified as Technology Professionals. They understand the role of technology in business or market development. Software engineers can design and guide the development of programs that computers use to make life a little easier for the rest of us. A software engineer is already considered as Chief Problem Solver and the role of the Digital marketer is also quite the same but related to marketing only. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two factors that define how engineers can be part of the digital industry &#8211; perfect online manpower: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineers are always considered as time-challenged where 44% of engineers are working on more projects now than they were two years ago and 55% of engineers are being asked to do more with less. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the age gap is important in digital marketing for industrial companies – 49% of engineers surveyed are less than 49 years old.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This proves that engineers can be potential manpower for any company with their intellectual mindset and problem-solving ability. Let’s discuss few reasons why an engineer should go for digital marketing training to be part of the marketing trend:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>To Be a Marketing Technologist</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of technology in marketing is now evolving from enabler to innovate which has become a primary reason why digital marketing experts are so much in demand. Online Marketing now truly powers and dominates the majority of innovations in marketing. Whereas software engineers are well coupled with technology and hands-on than the traditional marketer who relies heavily on the agencies and service providers. To have a good hand on website development is the important part of this online era where software engineer are well known for their programming background are native and comfortable with these web technologies.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Engineers can be creative as per the market</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of their front-end software technology skills, they are highly termed as creative people. Digital Marketing needs creativity when it comes to marketing strategies like A/B testing to analyze user experience and traffic etc. Where an engineer looks for challenges and new creative ways to overcome the market or business needs which is never enough in the digital marketing field. From selecting what kinds of products you want to sell to what kind of customers you want to target, every step involves steady analytical thinking which can be well planned by engineers.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Learn Latest Marketing Strategies / Modules</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good software engineers are continuous learners and experimentalists. They always look to improve their workflow and gain efficiencies by adopting latest tools, technologies, and best-practices. This is quite relevant to marketing where technology is changing rapidly and continuous learning and experimentation is the only way one can keep up with the latest trends. With Certified Digital Marketing Certification/Course, you can learn all available marketing strategies with the help of award-winning LMS programs and professional training. You have only infinity stopping you on your career growth. </span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Be a Problem Solver</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Software engineers are natural problem solvers and good software developers are always interested to solve business problems whether it&#8217;s technical or marketing. In addition, software engineers are great troubleshooter and debuggers. Most of the software engineers spend a major part of their professional life debugging the software. They know their toolchain and where to start when a problem occurs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With same attitude and knowledge, they can use their skills to debug all the marketing problems. Jobs in digital marketing need such kind of analytical skills. Whenever launching a new product into the e-market, a thorough analysis regarding the product is required which can be attained only by some expert. Digital Marketing is data-driven industry and engineers love to play with the data for sure. </span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>You can be a great support </b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Work involved in digital marketing deals a lot with creating many marketing strategies. Some of the analytical work that an engineer would enjoy is in Digital Marketing. There are many ways to succeed in digital marketing, full of various streams. In one way, you can help anyone with their content or run an advertisement, options vary. For example, if someone has shared the email marketing campaign with you and asked you to test but facing issues like;</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email links didn&#8217;t tag properly, so you cannot track anything</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renders incorrectly in various email clients, poor experience delivered</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorrect and confusing copy causing lot noise, as no one from legal was consulted</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can even solve these issues on your own only if you are well aware of the digital marketing concepts. </span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>More Job Opportunities &#8211; More Money</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for a skilled digital marketer is getting on nerves and not only in India itself, worldwide. There are more than 3.9 billion internet users all over the world and very less professional digital marketers to cover them. It’s exceedingly rare to find that there aren’t any job opportunities in the area, as these multinational companies are always hiring on the urge. So you will find the job opportunities everywhere. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where money is always a big driving point for anyone. Digital marketing is the new mint maker and the best part of it is that anyone who comes in contact with it is handed chunks of currency. With so many engineers produced every year. This should be a good reason why there should be more engineers in digital marketing. You will be renowned as Digital Marketing Engineer.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A digital marketing engineer is a member of a marketing team who applies web technology and digital marketing platforms with an agenda to achieve business’s marketing goals. It is a hybrid role involving both marketing and technology knowledge.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Draft your own Entrepreneur Journey</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A software engineer is always considered practical. Their practical sense and substance come because they know their craft. They are doors to a greater extent, and less of talkers. This may be a little hard for marketing folks, but you don&#8217;t get respect from software engineer unless you can walk the talk. If an engineer turned into an entrepreneur, he shouldn’t want to miss on the golden opportunity Digital Marketing presents to you. Marketing and sales are the heart of every business if you don’t know how your marketing is working for you, you’re just burning money and nobody likes that. With digital marketing learnings, you can collect data, understand what’s working for you and what’s not and make changes accordingly. </span>Also, software engineers are known for their creating new product skills. They can launch their new software and sell or promote the same through affiliate marketing (which is a most commonly part of digital marketing).
For example, you can see the journey of &#8211; the Master of Software Launch Funnels &#8211; how he launched software and promoted them through affiliate marketing. Have a look!

The Graphic Designing is part of marketing strategy that uses the number of artistic and professional disciplines (called as Graphic Designers), to convey a specific message or a piece of information or content to a group of people through various graphics such as pictures, shapes, lines, visuals etc.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The term Graphics Design is also referred to as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual Communication</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication Design</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The process of a designing often involves a graphic designer and a client where the end result is the viewer or consumer. The designer can use different topography skills, images, words, visual arts and page layout techniques in order to produce the final creative outcome without any rules and obligations. The designer arranges various elements of design on different media such as website, poster or a package with the help of various graphics software program. </span>
<b>Basic Tools used for Graphic Designing:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Illustrator</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Photoshop</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CorelDraw</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe InDesign</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuarkXPress</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Role of Graphics Designing in Business:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here I have stated top five reasons stating why one should incorporate graphic designing for business:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><b><i> Building a Brand Identity</i></b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic Designing is one of the important aspects of your business if you want to establish a brand image, to stand out from the competitors and help establish to create your own visual identity. Every business has its own identity &amp; strength. One should definitely not want to look like anybody else.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14280" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1-300x35.png" alt="Digiperform Logo" width="677" height="79" />
<b><i>     2. Helps create a Strong Impression</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A visual gives a great impact on person’s mind. As per the stats, the visuals receive 94 percent more engagement than any usual content. An impressive graphic design always leaves an impact on the audience in the first instance. The graphic design helps to grab attention and keep them hooked on.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14285" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Website-Images-300x176.jpg" alt="create a Strong Impression" width="692" height="406" />
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b><i> It helps to convey the Brand’s Message</i></b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the times it so happens when words cannot convey your brand’s information than videos or visual. It is at such times graphic designers can play a key role in conveying the message in the creative ways. Your business is complex with many products, sizes, colors and sizes and many other factors which are available. This can sometimes prove a little complex in conveying the accurate information. A good graphic design can communicate your offerings in the form of reports, charts, and illustrations.</span>
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b><i> A good graphic design can Narrate a Story</i></b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that readers or consumers get the feel of what brand is up to. A thoughtful and creative design captures the audience’s or a potential customer’s attention. Through pictures and graphics, one can share a story or moment to describe how your product has brought smiles to the customers. How your services have cheered the audiences? These little gestures can more precisely share through graphics rather than just a written content.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13328" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/5-300x157.png" alt="graphic design can Narrate a Story" width="675" height="353" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li><b><i> Maintains Consumer Trust</i></b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are living in an era where everything is online even from the minutes of information. A poor interactive design will not communicate your brand’s message effectively if the visual is not readable, and understood by the audience. As people respond quickly to a rich creative illustration, you should use every opportunity to develop consumer trust and confidence. A poor interface design can develop a rather an unfavourable image of the company.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14058" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/socialm-300x203.png" alt="Consumer Trust" width="479" height="324" />
<b>Scope for Graphic Designer:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The usefulness of graphic designer extends beyond designing the logo and website. Graphic design can produce a visual environment that will help to communicate your ideas. An informative and creative image can transmit ideas that cannot be expressed with words alone. You can use professionally designed images to create a positive impression and avoid misunderstandings. Graphic designers are required in so many industries like Advertisement industry, Print Industry, Web designing industry etc. If the person is a creative with heart &amp; soul and wants to showcase their wild imagination through graphics, then this is a right choice of career. </span>
<b>Role &amp; Responsibilities of a Graphic Designer:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic designers typically do the following: </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet with clients or the art director to determine the scope of a project</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advise clients on strategies to reach a particular audience</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine the message the design should portray</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create images that identify a product or convey a message</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop graphics for product illustrations, logos, and websites</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select colors, images, text style, and layout</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Present the design to clients or the art director</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporate changes recommended by the clients into the final design</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review designs for errors before printing or publishing them</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A note by our own Graphic Designer: <em><strong>Ritika Thakur</strong></em></span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14287" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dec-banner-3-300x169.jpg" alt="Graphic Designer: Ritika Thakur" width="651" height="367" />
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good design is the mainstay support of your business. You should utilize your graphic design in the best way possible which will promote the company objective and establish brand recognition. Graphic designers combine art and technology to communicate ideas through images and the layout of websites and printed pages. They may use a variety of design elements to achieve artistic or decorative effects.</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/role-graphic-designing-marketing-world/">Role of Graphic Designing in Digital Marketing World</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[A chit-chat session with one of our Ex-trainees as well as a housewife, <em><strong>Sweety Shah</strong></em>, who had a well-developed career as a Marketing Executive for 3 years decided to learn Digital Marketing to get skilled with latest marketing trends. Why? Let’s read to know further:
<b><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14205" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FB_IMG_1512727449524_2-300x243.jpg" alt="Sweety Shah" width="362" height="293" /></b>
<b>Q1- Please share your personal and professional background. What kind of business are you managing?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is </span><b><i>Sweety Shah</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I am a commerce graduate and have done MBA in Marketing as well. I have 3 yrs work experience in the healthcare industry as a Marketing Executive. I am married to a Doctor so I have started helping him in his side business (Medical Geek) as well. </span>
<a href="http://www.medicalgeek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Medical Geek</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Online Medical Forum</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where patients can consult doctors for their concerns and book appointment through the same platform. We have tied up with the major hospitals and reputed doctors to provide necessary assistance and guidance to the people whenever is required. I have learned digital marketing to handle the marketing of the website and promoting the same as well. </span>
<b>Q2- How you get to know about Digital Marketing? Why have you decided to learn it?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As per my marketing experience, I have realized how the marketing has evolved over the course of time; from traditional to digital. If you want to survive in the competition, you need to update yourselves regularly as per the different trends in Marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People are more active on the internet rather any other medium. They look for their answers only on the internet. It has become the sole medium of interaction as if you want to stay in regular touch with your audience and provide as well promote your services. Therefore, learning digital marketing become the utmost requirement for me. </span>
<b>Q3- How is Digital Marketing helping in your business?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is completely different from traditional marketing. In traditional marketing I need to meet people personally, convince, follow &amp; convert them into business or leads manually. Meetings and door to door marketing was the only solution earlier. However, Digital marketing makes work simple and convenient as I can target my audience according to demographic, pattern and age through digital mediums at just one click. No manual hardship is required. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Digital Marketing, I have started creating online campaigns and promoting my business on social media platforms. Plus it gives me a chance to take care of my family and provide helping hand to my husband as well. </span>
<b>Q4-How you feel digital marketing can help other women out there?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The women who want to continue their career even after marriage can definitely look for digital marketing. They can work from home as a freelancer. They don&#8217;t need to go out to work. They can manage both home and office at the same time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They can explore as per their interests as well, for example, if they are into writing, they can start their own blogs or earn through affiliate marketing. If they have business skills, then they can use it for their family businesses or they can start their own handy business as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The options are many, it’s all up to you how you long you want to consider yourself as independent and earning women. With your zeal to do something in life, Digital Marketing can be a blessing for working women as well housewife. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As there is a saying, <em>“When you will start doing it, first they will ask why you are doing it; later they would say how you did it.”</em></span>
<b>Q5- Why did you choose Digiperform over other digital marketing training companies?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly speaking, I am quite particular when it comes to spending my money. I had attended many demo classes before coming to <a href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>. Out of all, I was mentally ready to invest on Digiperform for the Internet Marketing Certification Course only. First, I liked their classroom training facilities. Secondly, there were like no pressurize from them to enroll the course like other training companies. They let me take the decision. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I liked their demo class which was given by one of the founders which showed how they really care for the batches and takes it as responsibility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I followed my search for online reviews &amp; testimonials and found out the Digiperform as best for me. </span>

We were given an access to LMS portal which has all the reading elements related to our course with exercises which helped us to understand the topic completely. Plus we had practical sessions related to campaigns and AdWords which really helped to clear our all doubts. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had different kind of batch where we had all kind of trainees such as students, entrepreneurs and working professionals which made our learning more entertaining as well helpful. Plus, I was new to Delhi, so I made good friends which made my digital marketing learning more fun</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The faculty is very good, response &amp; energetic. They made our class more interactive which helped us to learn more. They are always ready there to solve your problem at any point in time even after the completion of the course.</span>
<b>Q8- In your opinion, what is the scope of digital marketing in coming years?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In coming years, as our honorable PM is also enforcing to go digital way in every possible aspect, digital marketing will be booming. Digital marketing has taken place of traditional marketing as smartphone users are increasing day by day &amp; so the use of the internet which in turn definitely increase the scope of digital marketing. </span>
<b>Q9- What are your future plans?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with Medical Geek, I am planning to start home care services as well.</span>
<b>Q10- Would you like to give any message to your readers?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The readers are already digitalized and know the importance of the internet in their life. Its high time to become a digital professionally as well.  Even if you are not qualified I think digital marketing course is for everyone whether you hold any degree or not. One should have digital knowledge whether you are a student, entrepreneur, working professional or a lady at the house.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking for a dream job? Do you wish to grab more job opportunities? You want to be associated with well-known brands but looking for a right guidance to do it. To achieve success in these scenarios, you need to work on your personal branding first. Personal Branding is one the major killer skill that one should have if he/she aims to achieve big in career life. Especially when it comes to having a <a href="https://digiperform.com/get-high-paying-digital-marketing-job/">digital marketing job</a>, personal branding is one of the leading factors to determine your capabilities at the digital end.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14199" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/me-300x172.jpg" alt="Personal branding" width="581" height="333" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Morally, Personal branding is one of the tactics to market or showcase yourself for a better career as a Brand. The brand word specifically denotes a company or resource which has its own value and reputation. Similarly, you present your skills and achievements as a Brand to the hiring companies and showcase your talent in a pompous way. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of digitalization where the competition is so high, you should start taking your career seriously and represent yourself as the most confident &amp; ideal choice to all the employers. In this post, let’s discuss what are the ideal ways to Brand yourself as an expert to get more job offers especially in Digital Marketing?</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Create a Winning Resume</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The resume aka CV is always your first source to get attention from the employers. This is the first step to showcase your skills &amp; achievements and win over the potential employer. Before you start applying for digital marketing or any jobs, make sure to create an eye-catching resume that depicts how valuable your skills and achievements are. You need to showcase how worthy you are for the applied job. Stop looking for the same formats everywhere. There are many different types of resumes. You shouldn’t limit yourself to just one format.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be creative especially when you are working in a creative industry such as digital marketing. Or you can build online -website resume for yourself as well. What can be more creative than having your own online resume to represent as a Brand.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14198" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/web-resume-13-website-resume-sample-web-examples-websites-300x185.jpg" alt="represent as a Brand." width="715" height="441" />
<b>2) Be confident what you have learned and applying for</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The moronic thing done by the job seekers is to apply for the highly paid jobs but don’t prepare for it. For many careers, a minimum amount of education is necessary, however, if you want to excel in your career you may need to complete additional certification &amp; training like internet marketing certification or any degree. Getting additional certification helps to bring out the best skill for you.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14200" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/confident-300x219.png" alt="job seekers" width="508" height="371" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, irrespective of certifications, prepare yourself thoroughly and practically whenever you go or apply for interviews. One should not apply or attend any employer without any knowledge and experience related to same. For freshers, one should cover up all the elements theoretically to make sure to give a great first impression. </span>
<b>3) Use LinkedIn </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn is one of the ideal and best professional platforms to showcase your worth. Whatever your expertise or skills you have, make it clear on LinkedIn. Showcase your achievements from the time period from school to job. Share the projects or volunteer programs you have handled so far. LinkedIn focuses solely on professional connections rather than any personal commitment to further your career. The site allows you to use your areas of expertise, education, and experience to tap into business opportunities and new ventures.</span>
<b><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14173" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-07-at-3.09.10-PM-300x254.png" alt="Aditi Khinda Linkedin" width="588" height="498" /></b>
<b>4) Build your online presence</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get hired by the right company or client, he/she will definitely look for you when they consider a professional relationship as well on social platforms which is, obviously, online. For example, if you’re advising to someone as the right candidate for any organization and stating that you can deliver a successful digital marketing campaign, you must have real-time evidence of the same where they can find for themselves like social media campaigns or your blogs shared on platforms. </span>
<b>5) Build Relationships</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing in marketing is more powerful compared to any promotion tool i.e. word-of-mouth, which can be defined as what people say about you. The same is the scenario in building your career as a brand as well. What your network of contacts, friends, colleagues, customers, clients, and former bosses say about you and your set of skills, education, and accomplishments. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to keep in good contact with your network and be sure they know of your most recent successes. You need to understand that the best brand-builders don’t stop with their current network; these folks are in constant network-building mode. Try to search out new professional associations as well as the growing number of online networking communities.</span>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is more important and builds credibility in your career as a brand more than establishing yourself as an expert in your field. Start by writing articles or sharing your work that showcases your skills and getting them published in noteworthy media outlets. Consider self-publishing as on one is going to it for you. Seek out conferences and meetings where you can give speeches and presentations then share on your social media. Play up awards and other recognition that can help label you an expert.</span>
