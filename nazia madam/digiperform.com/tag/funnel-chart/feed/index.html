			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A funnel chart is a graphical tool that displays the percentage of a given population that falls into each category of a given data set. The data is typically displayed in descending order, with the largest category at the top and the smallest at the bottom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts are often used to visualize sales data, where the width of each bar corresponds to the size of the sale, and the height of the bar corresponds to the percentage of sales within that category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts can also be used to visualize other types of data, such as the number of website visits that result in a purchase, or the number of email subscribers that result in a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can even be used to show how data moves through a specific process in subsequent stages. A great </span><a href="https://www.tibco.com/reference-center/what-is-a-funnel-chart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funnel chart example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be anything from sales funnels to order fulfillment processes.

<h4>How to Create a Funnel Chart</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-39410 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-3-300x199.jpg" alt="funnel chart" width="609" height="404" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-3.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts are used to visualize the proportions of a whole over a series of steps. They are often used to visualize the conversion rates of a process, such as the number of leads that convert to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts can be created in Excel using the pie chart tool, and then converted to a stacked bar chart. This chart type is a simple and easy way to visualize a process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top of the funnel is the first stage while the bottom bar of the funnel is the final stage. The bars in between indicate the various stages in descending order, forming the shape of the funnel.</span></p>

<h4>Benefits of Using a Funnel Chart</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A funnel chart can be used to visualize data that is collected from a survey or to track the progress of a project. The funnel shape shows the decrease of data as it moves down a subsequent stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main benefits of using a funnel chart is that it allows you to quickly and easily see how data decreases in a process. Additionally, funnel charts are easy to create and understand, making them a popular choice for data visualizations. They are perfect for highlighting the differences between proportions at different stages of a process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funnel charts also make it easy to identify any areas that require improvement within the data set. And they can be used in a wide variety of business and marketing contexts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chart type is a great way to communicate complex data in a concise and visually appealing way. They are an effective way to make data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Funnel Charts in Real-Life Application</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39411 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-4-300x200.jpg" alt="funnel chart " width="711" height="474" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/unnamed-4.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say you&#8217;re the marketing director for a large company. You&#8217;ve been tasked with increasing the number of leads your company generates each month. To do this, you&#8217;ve decided to invest in a marketing automation tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You set up a lead capture form on your company&#8217;s website and begin collecting data on the number of leads your new tool generates each day. After a few weeks of </span><a href="https://www.behaimits.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you create a funnel chart to visualize the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the number of leads your tool generates each day is gradually increasing. This is a great trend, and you&#8217;re excited to see how it develops over time. The funnel chart allows you to track your progress and make necessary adjustments to your strategy as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you notice that the number of leads drops off around the middle of the funnel, you might need to adjust your marketing tool to be more effective and improve the </span><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/interactive/customer-experience-index"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being able to visualize customer dropout can help you improve your business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some components of what makes a funnel chart and how they can be used.</span></p>
