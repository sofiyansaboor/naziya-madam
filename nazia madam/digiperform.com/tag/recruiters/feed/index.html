<img class="size-full wp-image-24184 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot-2019-09-17-at-1.01.06-PM.png" alt="Get hired" width="582" height="317" />
Consider this post as the one-step to digital marketing freshers career guide who are want to make something big in this digital industry. Readout what kind of strategy recruiters have while hiring you?
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Do You Have A Specialty?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers with no specific focus are considered generalists and they can be really useful. But if you’re looking for someone to run your Instagram page you may want to consider hiring someone who focuses on Instagram and will know how to gain followers and likes for your benefit. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you don’t need a social media specialist you can almost certainly find someone who focuses on what you do need. Do you need a technical writer? A blogger? No matter what you need there will be someone who fits the bill so figure out what you need in order to find the people or person who’s strongest suits line up.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputed digital marketers like to flex their skills and are usually active in industry help forums. Established digital marketing experts are proud of their work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An industry expert, someone who knows what works with clients (and has the experience to back it up) might be an integral part of your digital marketing dream team.</span>
<h2><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-15-at-6.29.32-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-22973 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-15-at-6.29.32-PM.png" alt="Digital marketer" width="489" height="410" /></a></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>What, Exactly, is Your Specific Plan for Your Business?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you articulate your business goals and know what you want to achieve, what’s their plan? What results/reports might you expect? Will their approach to editorial content do right by your brand and give you quality content with and a good ROI? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the recruiter, they keep asking questions until everything is clear. As they believe, if they can’t explain everything clearly, thoroughly, and to the satisfaction, they are not a good fit. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good partnerships come from ironing out expectations before the contract is signed. If you can’t communicate your goals then it’s unlikely they will hire you. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Are You Ready To Learn?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good digital marketer will not only be ready to learn your business and its needs but will also be ready to roll with the ever-changing technology and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they find someone with the passion and drive to continually learn and improve what the candidate is doing that is someone they are going to want on their team for the long haul. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a digital marketer is self-motivated and ready to dive in however you see fit that is a sure sign they will be able to go above and beyond to solve problems you may encounter. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the digital world, the user has to be the primary target and a marketer has to be willing to get in the heads of the target audience to figure out how to best communicate with them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology rapidly changes so does what will work from a marketing viewpoint and as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media is ever-changing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so too does your marketing plan. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Are You Efficient With Time?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They could be the best digital marketer on the planet but if they miss deadlines then that isn’t helpful to you in the slightest. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing can be overwhelming since it moves pretty fast. Before handing over assignments or contracting with a digital marketing firm, they might give you a test run to get a sense of your professional strengths. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good digital marketer will come up with a plan and be proactive and persuasive to make it happen in a timely manner. They will not only have the attention to detail needed but they will also be able to move at a pace that keeps projects rolling so your company doesn’t miss any important deadlines. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Are You A Team Player?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be honest, anyone would want someone who has a specialty right? So you can be the expert in your own area so they don’t have to be, but if you aren’t willing to communicate and work well with the other people with different specialties then you aren&#8217;t heading anywhere fast. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse than not being able to work with the team is working with a bad attitude. Seriously, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2012/01/23/89-of-new-hires-fail-because-of-their-attitude/#6d6cc94e137a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">46% of new hires will fail within 18 months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not because they lack the skills or motivation but because they have bad attitudes and that spills over into the work and your working environment. While attitude can be cultivated it can be detrimental to your company if it is not. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity is improved when morale is high, everyone wants to do a better job when they are happy because they see the purpose behind the work. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enthusiasm is contagious but contempt can spread too, it’s important to find a digital marketer who is eager and excited rather than showing reluctance to associate from the beginning. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Look For The Value</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Too often businesses get caught up in the money. They either want the best that money can buy or the exact opposite, to save as much money as possible. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither strategy is going to pay off without noting the value of the person they would eventually hire. They judge a candidate by their performance indicators and then determine what&#8217;s your worth. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone brings a different set of skills to the table you aren’t used to that can improve their value. If a social media expert has previously seen scenarios like yours and can show you how they were able to help, again their value goes up. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t get caught up in your mind of what you think someone is worth, wait until you see what you are capable of. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best digital marketers will be able to adapt quickly to your business practices as well as learning new techniques and ideas on a daily basis. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you find the right company to with you can be assured your career will be represented by someone who will do a great job. If you look back over these suggestions you will remain competitive in your field. </span>
