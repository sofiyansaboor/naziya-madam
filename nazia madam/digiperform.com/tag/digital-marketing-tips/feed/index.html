										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a small business, it can be hard to know where to start when it comes to <a href="https://digiperform.com/10-ways-to-spice-up-social-media-presence-of-your-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improving your social media presence</a> or creating a website that’s functional and accessible to consumers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve success, you should know the <a href="https://digiperform.com/6-benefits-of-using-digital-marketing-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefits of using digital marketing</a> and how it can help you stay on top and ensure consumers can easily seek out your services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To help get you started, here are 10 digital marketing tips for your small business.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Research Competitors</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren’t sure where you’re going wrong, it can be helpful to check out competitors in your field to see what they’re doing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitor research is crucial for any company, as you will want to offer as much value as you can to the market. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply doing a Google search can be a great place to start as you will be able to see how your rivals are positioning themselves with their advertisements. </span>
Let say, if you have an online domain selling business, and you searched &#8216;<em><strong>Buy Domain</strong></em>&#8216; on Google, then <em>hostinger, Godaddy and Hostgator</em> will be your top 3 competitors.

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-24919 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/competitor-analysis-1-300x249.png" alt="competitor-analysis" width="655" height="544" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to differentiating yourself and creating a unique selling point for your company, there are several things to think about, such as the products you deliver, the costs of your services, as well as your brand image and reputation.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Sort Your Website Basics First</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With online users being spoilt for choice when seeking out businesses, consumers are becoming increasingly demanding on the type of experience they expect from your website. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandably, they will want your website to load as quickly as possible, therefore, using various tools such as Google’s PageSpeed Insights can give you a better indication of how you can decrease the loading time of your business page.</span>
<h2><b><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24921 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Google-PageSpeed-test-300x171.png" alt="Google PageSpeed test" width="696" height="397" /></b></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Improve Reputation</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business, your online reputation is everything. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If customers and clients aren’t happy with your services, they may be likely to leave a negative rating or review on your page which can turn potential customers away. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, there are tools out there such as Google My Business which can provide you with a level of control to check how others perceive your business. Here is an example:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24922 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/google-reviews-300x214.jpg" alt="google reviews" width="765" height="546" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are common mistakes that you need to avoid too, such as posting duplicate listings or adding unnecessary promotional messages. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you want to attract people to your business, not scare them away!</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Create Interesting Content</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what sector of business you’re in, the chances are you have many competitors who are fighting for the same custom as you, therefore it’s crucial that you come up with innovative and interesting content that catches consumers’ eyes. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business, it’s highly unlikely that you will rank on the first page of Google’s search results, so you will need to do all that you can to stand out from the crowd and entice people to check out your page. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve created a business blog, there are lots of tips that you can take on board, such as making sure you put your audience first, using the correct tone of voice, as well as showing readers that they can trust your brand.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Consider Google Ads</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally known as Google AdWords, </span><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6349091?hl=en-GB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is being used more and more by small businesses to help drive traffic to their page.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24924 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Google-Ads-300x236.jpg" alt="Google Ads" width="681" height="536" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The program enables you to create online ads that can reach your target audience who are likely to be interested in the products and services you have to offer.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> When creating a Google Ads search campaign, it’s crucial that you pick the right keywords to help boost your search engine ranking.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Optimize Your Website for Smartphones</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With many of us leading busier lives than ever, most consumers don’t have the time to sift through your website on their laptop or PC, therefore, making sure your website is optimized for smartphones can help the consumer out and enable them to check out your page while on the go.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-24925 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mobile-optimize-300x291.jpg" alt="mobile-optimize" width="368" height="357" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take into account that more than 80% of internet users regularly browse the internet on their smartphone, it makes perfect sense to adapt your website accordingly. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Use SEO</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business, </span><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/8-things-every-business-needs-to-know-about-seo_b_59833b97e4b094ff5a3f0c47"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be your best friend when it comes to increasing traffic to your page and building a customer and client base. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO (search engine optimization) is all about improving your search engine ranking result, helping make it easier for consumers to seek out your products and services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important that you create a website and blog that is SEO friendly, otherwise, your audience may not be aware of your presence on the market.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Make Use of Social Media</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most small businesses have social media pages to let their followers know about the latest promotions and goings-on in their company, however, there’s a fine line between sharing information and spamming consumers with content they’re not interested in. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing you want to do is turn your audience off, so to build trust and brand loyalty, make sure that you engage with your customers as they will be more inclined to engage with you, rather than skimming past your content.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Use Email Marketing</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the most efficient and cost-effective marketing tools, there is for small businesses, email marketing is a great digital marketing tip when it comes to growing your brand loyalty and connecting with your target demographic in a powerful way. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When using the right incentives and strategies, not only can you bring in new clients to your business, but you can ensure your existing customers stay loyal to your brand.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Gain New Skills and Qualifications</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To run a successful business, it’s important that you have the right skills and qualifications behind you, therefore, undergoing training or studying a course can teach you the knowledge you need for success. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://online.kettering.edu/programs/masters/operations-management-masters-degree-online"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studying an MS in operations management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online can teach you more about marketing management and operations management, which are key aspects of business, especially when coming up with digital marketing strategies. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how long you’ve been running your small business, it can be easy to let operations slide, which can result in disastrous consequences for your company. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using all the tips listed to your advantage can help point customers and clients in the right direction to the products and services you have to offer. </span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/10-digital-marketing-tips-for-your-small-business/">10 Digital Marketing Tips for Your Small Business</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monica Gandhi, Business Head at Technicians, is a natural “<em>Trusted Advisor</em>” who helps companies to meet their sales and marketing targets. In this post, she has shared the <em><strong>10 Things to Consider Before Going for <a href="http://www.purplesyntax.com/SEO-Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO Services</a></strong></em><strong>.</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are looking for the best <a href="https://seoserviceinindia.co.in/">SEO services in India</a> or any other country these factors will support in finding the perfect service for your organization. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a good practice to be followed these days. It is constantly inviting changes in its practice. The changes are simply done to provide a good user experience. Unlike old SEO practices which could be handled with the help of cheap backlinks and heavy keyword density, modern SEO works with a fully integrated strategy. The companies that once completely relied on their in-house Search Engine Optimizer are now out looking for a company that consists of SEO experts. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may require more than one or two SEO experts to deal with increased content demand, good backlinks, and working with Google priorities with complete knowledge of it. Whereas a good such as <a href="https://seoservicescompany.co.in/noida/">SEO company in Noida</a> can help you climb the ladders of success, on the other hand, it’s vice versa can trick you in black hat technique and leave you with less amount of traffic. While hiring a good SEO team, there is no restriction of being an expert, simply keep in mind the above 10 things and you&#8217;ll be successful in gaining a good one for your company.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>1.WHY ARE YOU APPROACHING THE SEO TEAM? WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even an SEO team can have further divisions. What all are your expectations and how would you like the team to work is one of the most important factors. Until and unless the team and you aren’t clear about the goals and procedure, you cannot proceed further. Choose a team, which would provide you: </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Technical SEO</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This team takes care of the code, site design, speed, and all the other metrics which are directly or indirectly linked to the traffic of your site. The technical SEO team ensures good and easy use of the web page to avoid any kind of user inconvenience. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li><b><i>User experience(UX)</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; It revolves around the content. An SEO expert would analyze the customer facets and improve as well as organize the content accordingly.</span></li>
 	<li><b><i>Off-page SEO</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; It means promoting your services via earning links. Strengthening the popularity of your brand is done by the SEO agency.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure while hiring the SEO agency, you confirm these three expectations from it. Also that they have a clear execution strategy ahead. Not only SEO company in Noida takes care of these three needs but explains to you its future plans for your betterment. </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14381" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.36.41-PM-300x134.png" alt="SEO agency" width="708" height="316" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> STRATEGY OF AGENCY TOWARDS YOUR GOALS</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://attrock.com/search-engine-optimization/">SEO services</a> have no universal solution. Every agency has its own ways to manage and work till the desired goals aren’t reached. As your business needs a unique execution approach to stand apart from the crowd. Since your goals are different, you would probably expect your team to work on it and find unique strategies, models, and ideas to uplift your business over the internet. SEO agency would probably cater to your goals, model, deadline, and does its best to exceed your expectations.  </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14382" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.36.50-PM.png" alt="SEO agency noida" width="449" height="438" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>3.TIME DURATION OF EXPECTED RESULTS</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact cannot be denied that <a href="https://digiperform.com/search-engine-optimization-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO</a> takes time to display its results. This doesn’t mean that an SEO agency would set a time frame in front of you. For example, <a href="https://seoservicescompany.co.in/delhi/">SEO services in Delhi</a> take no longer than 6 months to showcase their results. The result is directly linked to the condition of your site. More traffic is directly proportional to good results. If the site is possibly well structured and free of any technical issue, you are more likely to achieve the results faster than you have thought. Question back your SEO agency to know their intentions more clearly at every point in time.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14383" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.01-PM-300x127.png" alt="seo result" width="673" height="285" />
<ol start="4">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> APPROACH TO MOBILE &#8211;</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that your SEO agency has an approach to mobile too. Ever since Mobile has been given birth, with its improved technicalities the importance of it is reaching heights. It is a very good idea to optimize the mobile too for a better and user-friendly platform. SEO service providers have mobile optimization included in it as more than half of customers are made from the mobile approach which surely defines the perks of <a href="https://digiperform.com/what-is-mobile-marketing/">Mobile Marketing</a>.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14384" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.11-PM-300x225.png" alt="mobile seo" width="477" height="358" />
<ol start="5">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> HOW TO CONDUCT KEYWORD RESEARCH-</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, keyword research simply meant to generate relevant keywords from a keyword generator tool. Modern keyword research requires extra effort. It focuses on the user intent. In this, the agency thinks what users possibly might require and what possibilities they could type over the internet to reach that piece of information. SEO agency ensures keyword research and has well-defined methodologies to determine the right keyword for that particular piece of content.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14394" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-2.10.32-PM.png" alt="process of keyword research" width="472" height="324" />
<ol start="6">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> TOOLS TO BE USED &#8211;</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of the tool holds no importance but the reason behind it holds the most. There are certain questions that hold great importance and SEO services in Noida have undoubtedly answered all &#8211; </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are all <a href="https://digiperform.com/latest-digital-marketing-tools/">Digital Marketing Tools</a> being used to monitor and why?</span></li>
 	<li>Type of crawler you use and the reason behind it?</li>
 	<li>What tools are used to conduct keyword research and why?</li>
 	<li>How do you perform competitor analysis?</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your agency has a valid answer to each question stated above. </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14387" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.46-PM-300x161.png" alt="SEO STRATEGY " width="596" height="320" />
<ol start="7">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> IS YOUR SEO STRATEGY COPING UP WITH YOUR OVERALL MARKETING STRATEGY? </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid the companies who choose to perform their tasks in complete isolation. SEO happens along with content marketing, social media marketing, and public relations. SEO company is flexible enough to collaborate with other marketing teams meanwhile. For effective link building, it is important to cope with all other teams as well.</span>
<a href="http://www.networkingvidya.com/on-page-seo-strategies-step-by-step-guide/"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14388" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.37.55-PM-300x169.png" alt="SEO STRATEGY For Marketing" width="591" height="333" /></a>
<ol start="8">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> REPORT ON PROGRESS &#8211; </b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO agency provides a sample of the report generation. This is useful to learn the methodologies of the agency you are working with. Beware of the companies who do not cater to your needs, especially when you request them to provide a detailed progress report. Now that you have already shared your goals with them and then they can tell how they can customize your progress report. No matter, SEO report totally depends on the size of reports but in the end, it ought to be detailed and well understood. Bigger companies or shorter projects may require detailed reports.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14389" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-12.38.05-PM-300x211.png" alt="SEO Report" width="536" height="377" />
<ol start="9">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> HOW TO STAY UP TO DATE IN THE INDUSTRY?</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may definitely require someone who wholeheartedly participates in discussion forums and reads all popular SEO blogs. This is important to remain updated with the latest industry trends. Best SEO professionals like SEO agencies in Noida opt for this practice themselves. This research is useful in conducting necessary changes in the algorithm to follow the best practice which would automatically result in good ones.</span>

<ol start="10">
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b> NEED OF BEING EFFECTIVE</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO companies must have a long list of questions. They will conduct a session where they will be asking your goals, deadline and would advise you to use other digital marketing platforms if they found that it is indirectly affecting your business. They are also going to ask you for Google analytics access to them. Effective SEO is a result of a good partnership between the multiple teams and the company.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14395" src="https://digiperform.in/backup/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-28-at-2.10.10-PM-232x300.png" alt="benefits of sem" width="447" height="578" />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, whenever you plan a wedding, you list few of your ideas and have expectations to be followed for the occasion. You do proper analysis regarding what theme to be used for wedding, colors and so on to make it a memorable experience. Similarly, you should plan your business’ marketing strategies followed by complete analysis. To create a meaningful strategy, you need to conduct a deep level of research which is followed by competitors to have an overview of the market trends. Most businesses would rather not take the risk, especially when the information is easily available on the World Wide Web. So why would one create a <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-strategies-explode-business-2018/">digital marketing strategy</a> without a competitor analysis?</span>
<b>What is Competitor Analysis?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitor analysis is one of the strategies of digital marketing that helps to identify your competitors&#8217; values and evaluate their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to those of your own brand, product or service. It helps to gain a level of insight that allows you to evolve your digital marketing strategies based on competitor insight. It offers the complete guidance and direction to the type of activity you want to perform. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed it’s a time-consuming strategy to be followed, meaning you need to be as efficient as possible in your research; however, it’s a result-oriented. Using a competitor analysis develops to create a strategy based on complete evidence, and heading down a right path without failing and working without a cohesive plan.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxgs0jBLaIk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a marketing competitive analysis helps you:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare the topics, tactics, and channels driving market performance for you and your competitors.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncover opportunities to outperform the competition and differentiate your brand.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmark your brand against competitors, industry leaders, and market influencers.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>How to do a Competitive Analysis?</b>
<b><i>Choose the right metrics:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many marketers struggle to identify the right metrics to track their performance. Tracking your audience growth on social media and other channels allows you to determine the increases and decreases in your brand’s digital audience. By benchmarking audience growth against competitors you can spot where competitors are having a greater impact and improving your brand awareness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of marketing channels you could use in a competitive analysis:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earned media</span></li>
</ul>
<b><i>Website Audit:</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most obvious part of any Competitor Analysis. At the surface level, it’s simply looking at their site, seeing what works well and what doesn’t. If a competitor has had a new website created that is easier to navigate than yours, then it is the foremost to explain why your conversions have dropped. Simultaneously, if you suddenly get a significant increase in conversions then you should seek out the answer as to why that is. The deeper level of analysis signifies things such as load times, server response times and overall website responsiveness. Ensuring every page of a website is not only responsive to different screen sizes and browsers but also friendly to them.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2herjSjceM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<b><i>Paid Search Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With search audit tools, it’s possible to find a lot of insight into the Paid Search habits of your competitors, estimate their budgets and understand the balance they strike between Paid and Organic Search. Using the same report, it can help to evaluate what keywords are valuable enough that your competitors are willing to pay money to be seen for? This audit can provide insight into what keywords are leading to conversions (sales) for your competitors.</span>
<b><i>Social Media Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As social media content continues to increase as touch points on the path to purchase across many industries, understanding what social channels are driving the most traffic is important. If a competitor is receiving a substantial amount of social traffic from Facebook, one should know what types of content they’re posting and how frequently.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14374" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BuzzSumo-1024x574-300x168.png" alt="Social Media Audit" width="716" height="401" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the vast area where it is difficult to analyze without certain digital marketing tools. On the deeper side of the analysis, you can look at large amounts of data to ascertain levels of engagement of their fan base, whether it appears they are using certain strategies and if there are useful findings such as optimum posting times for your target demographics that you could apply to your social media strategy.</span>
<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEViF6tTqG4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<b><i>SEO/Keywords Audit</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying Keywords that are common to you and your competitors is key to succeed in this competitive strategy. Unfortunately, there will be times when you simply may not be able to rank for a keyword you want to organically but on the flip side, you can focus on gaining those keywords you already show dominance in. Having a thorough understanding of the Keyword terms targeted by your competitors along with maps of their search traffic will help inform both your own Organic and Paid Search strategy going forward. It is also once again an indicator of how seriously they take their Digital Marketing and the strategies they are employing. The key to strategic insight is the range of data looked at and the depth of the analysis. It is simple to see what Keywords your competitors are ranking for now.</span>
<b><i><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-14376" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cc-300x165.jpg" alt="SEO/Keywords Audit" width="691" height="380" /></i></b>
<b><i>Local Presence</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of local search terms such as ‘near-me’ have been well documented but even without them, local searches make up a huge portion of product/service based search terms. Knowing whether your competitors are taking full advantage of all of the Local Directory Listings lets you know where there could be yet more easy wins.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13041" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2.3-300x189.png" alt="Local Presence" width="390" height="246" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of businesses know by now that they should have claimed and completed their Google My Business (used to be Google Places) listings. Surprisingly very, very few business have engaged in any strategy to ensure their reviews are linked to these listings. A comprehensive review of all Local Directories will show where your competitors have left gaps that you can take advantage of in as little as a few minutes.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are many tools such as <em>SimilarWeb, Google Advanced Search Operators, SEMRush, Google Alerts</em> etc that you can utilize to track the performance and digital marketing strategies of your top competitors.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monica Gandhi, Business Head at Technians, is a natural “<em>Trusted Advisor</em>” who helps companies to meet their sales and marketing targets. In this post, she has shared the <em><strong>10 ways to improve Inbound Marketing Strategy</strong></em>.
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unlike outbound marketing, inbound focuses on the creating an engaging content which attracts customers itself. The content is updated on certain channels and while surfing through those channels, customers get attracted to the content. By creating a designed content, they address the problems of the customers and give a solution to it. Since real-time customers spend some time reading to it, they find themselves on the correct boat and further get attached to the company. Many <a href="http://technians.com/seo-services/"><span class="s2"><b>SEO Company in Delhi</b></span></a> provides such services for a various organization. The relevant and good content adds on the chain of potential customers. One can add trust and credibility to the business through it. Inbound marketing strategy consumes less of the efforts and produces more of the positive results. This methodology promises to convert strangers to the promoters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first step of inbound strategy is content i.e &#8211; blogging. In order to attract the right customers to your firm, make sure your content speaks something informational. The second very step is buying process i.e &#8211; customer strategy. Make sure you answer all the common doubts of customers in your content. Last but not the least, social media helps in uplifting the content. Let&#8217;s discuss in more details.</span></p>

<ol class="ol1">
 	<li class="li2"><span class="s1"><b>BLOGGING</b> &#8211; The blogging is known to be the face of the company. Many businessmen simply focus on the keywords keeping the quality of content aside. But this is a huge misconception that adding only keywords irrespective of the quality would improve the ranking of the site. Nowadays, brands are focusing more on the quality of content and wish to solve the problems of real-time customers. Google is focusing on providing the most useful information in short duration of time to start focusing on the content which you deliver on your page. No doubt creative and relevant content is going to take some time but it will add worth to your site.</span></li>
</ol>

<span class="s2"><b>2. CONNECTIONS VIA EMAIL</b> &#8211; Most of us receive hundreds of email every day out of which few are relevant. In this case, we tend to ignore the emails which are not relevant to our work. So in that case, businessmen fail to connect with us regularly. Perhaps, email is considered the most effective ways to inform the customers about the business updates regularly. Talking about the brand, even they do not focus on the type of emails they are sending to the customers. Many of us expect the content to be vital for us but turn out into disappointed faces when we don’t get what we expect. Brands need to focus on the content and infographics they are delivering to their customers because many of us believe that the brand would surprise us at every step. </span>

<span class="s2"><b>4. SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION</b> &#8211; SEO is one of the most misunderstood aspects of online marketing.
