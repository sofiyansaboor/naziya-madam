										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are carving out a long-term digital marketing strategy for your business, SEO serves as the base of it. Without investing in SEO, you can’t expect long-term results. But SEO takes time &#8212; sometimes three months, sometimes a little more than that, and some industries even require a year-long investment to rank on Google.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone looking for instant results, or boost visibility in a competitive niche when top results are dominated by high-authority sites, PPC is the best option. In exchange for a few bucks, you can acquire the top spot on Google.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds easy? It isn’t! Running successful PPC campaigns is science itself, you have to research, experiment, and set new campaigns based on the data gathered from previous campaigns to create optimized PPC ads for your business.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the free tools you can use to nail your PPC ads is Google Alerts. In this article, I’m going to show you how!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What is Google Alerts?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, it’s a notification tool that lets you track when people use certain keywords or keyphrases online. This knowledge ultimately helps you to optimize the existing campaigns and fill in the gaps.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me demonstrate its use with the help of an example.</span>

<strong><i>Say you’re selling chocolates online. You run separate PPC campaigns for each of the chocolates in your stock, such as Mars, Snickers, Cadbury, etc. You can set alerts for certain events, for example whenever someone mentions your company’s name, or the chocolates you’re selling, or post similar content, etc. you get a notification.</i></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that Google only sends you alerts whenever new content is published; you get no notifications about the content that’s already published. And it’s reported that Google doesn’t send you every page that is indexed on Google.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To use Google Alerts, you must be aware of the operators used to set alerts for specific queries. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>How to Set Up Google Alerts?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up Google Alerts barely takes a minute or two. However, in your very first attempt, it might take a bit of time and thinking to set up your first alert.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the step-by-step process:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to google.com/alerts and sign up, or sign in if you already have a Google account.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure it’s the same account where you want to receive alerts.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will see a top bar with a search option, enter the query or phrase for which you want to be notified.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have entered the query, you will see several options below it regarding the region, language, frequency of query, sources, and the place where you want to be notified about it.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the frequency of alerts is concerned, you can receive an alert instantly when the research is made, or once in a week or month.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By choosing a particular company, you can limit the alerts &#8212; that means you will only get an alert when a certain phrase is searched in your target region.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve never used Google Alerts before, I suggest you check out a couple of video demonstrations on YouTube.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>How does it Help in PPC?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, so now you know what Google Alerts are and how you can set up alerts yourself. It’s time to walk you through how this tool can amplify your PPC efforts and bring the best results.</span><b></b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Use Google Alerts to Find Trending Topics</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re not sure which keywords and topics should you target in your campaigns, Google Alert brings a myriad of ideas. In fact, you can begin your content ideas research from here by setting up alerts against keywords relevant to your industry.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every new alert will give you potential phrases and words to use in your next PPC ad copy. You will also discover the strengths of your competitors, the vacuum in your industry, and ultimately improve the results of your ads.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><b>Spy on Your Competitors</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Manual competitor research demands an abundance of time and focus. You can’t find the loopholes in your competitor’s ad if you don’t analyze every element from ad copy to the visuals used. Besides that, every day you have to Google relevant queries to see the results.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Alerts makes this quite straightforward. Just set up an alert with your competitor’s website mentioned in the alert against certain keywords and get alerts whenever a change is made to their ad.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><b>Dig Valuable Data &amp; Use it to Improve</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running successful PPC campaigns is all about experimenting and tracking what’s working and what isn’t. If you’re not getting results, this could be due to a weak ad copy, targeting the wrong audience, or showing your ads at the wrong time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Alerts bring insights regarding your audience. And this data helps you to evaluate your performance and see if months of PPC expenditures have done any good to your online reputation. Do people know you in your industry or not?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can receive alerts if someone types your brand’s name or your product on Google. This way, you will get plenty of information related to demographics, the type of audience mentioning you or search you on Google, and the frequency of those mentions.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the leading </span><a href="https://www.digitalgravity.ae/services/digital-marketing/pay-per-click/"><b>PPC Services in Dubai</b></a><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">we know the kind of boost well-optimized PPC campaigns can provide to your business. But you only get desired results if you create and manage them the right way. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Alerts will give you campaign ideas, pinpoint the loopholes in your ads and the strengths of your competitors, and you will eventually be able to create campaigns that generate thousands of dirhams in revenue!</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google keeps on taking comprehensive measures to improve the advertising platform and streamline its offerings. Just after declaring that Google will provide <a href="https://digiperform.com/google-india-commences-telugu-language-support-for-google-adwords-and-adsense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telugu language support for Google AdWords &amp; AdSense</a>, Google is </span><b><i>rebranding</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its ads line up and introducing some new solutions to simplify its advertising offerings. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from July 24, 2018, </span><a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/9028765?utm_source=msa&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=google_ads_rebrand&amp;utm_content=adwords_to_ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Google AdWords will become Google Ads</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which will represent the full range of campaign types including Search, Display, and Video. However, the changes to the Google Ads branding will not impact its ads pricing, campaign performance, navigation, or reporting. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ads-image.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-17220 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ads-image.png" alt="" width="528" height="233" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The update is specifically designed to target small businesses as another effort to break down the entry of new advertisers. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small businesses specifically, we&#8217;re introducing a new campaign type in Google Ads that makes it easier than ever to get started with online advertising,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the post reads. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It brings the machine learning technology of Google Ads to small businesses and helps them get results without any heavy lifting so they can stay focused on running their business.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the small businesses will soon be able to use this new update and create &#8220;</span><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-is-retiring-the-adwords-doubleclick-brands-in-a-major-rebranding-aimed-at-simplification-301073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><i>Smart Campaigns</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;, which is essentially the Google Ads technology tailored for smaller businesses. With this product, Google intends to make creating ads easier especially for newcomers to target the potential audience; while assuring those ads end up in front of the right audience.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>From July onwards, you will see the following changes:</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Google Ads new name and logo will be seen in the product interface, Help Center, billing documents, and more.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The URL user uses to access the account will be automatically changing from adwords.google.com to ads.google.com.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help Center will change from support.google.com/adwords to support.google.com/google-ads.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with that, the rebranding has led forward to including few more changes to other Google offerings &#8211; the </span><b><i>DoubleClick Digital Marketing</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b><i>Google Analytics 360 Suite</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brands. Therefore, there will now be three primary brands:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google AdWords is now Google Ads.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DoubleClick advertiser products and Google Analytics 360 Suite are now under the brand Google Marketing Platform.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange are integrated into a new unified platform called Google Ad Manager.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has ensured that the products are not changing, they have made primarily changes to develop new ad products, formats, and measurement solutions to meet new needs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two decades, the complexity of products have made harder for advertisers, publishers and agencies to decide which product is ideal for their Google needs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new branding under three buckets with all in one feature will make easier for marketers to figure out best in the starting and look for solutions easily.</span>
