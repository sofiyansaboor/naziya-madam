										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influencer marketing</a> is not a big term, especially for teens. While scrolling Instagram or other visual-centric platforms, you will come across many teenagers sharing videos and pictures in very innovative ways. There is ‘n’ number of lifestyle bloggers, vloggers, influencers, etc. that are juggling to get millions of followers and make money out of it.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18624 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/influennn.png" alt="" width="413" height="322" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you take influencing as a career or part-time passion, you can make it BIG only if you follow the right influencer marketing strategy. Sharing different cuisines pictures or traveling videos may seem easy and happening, but it takes a lot of valuable consistent content and innovative strategies to get renowned influencer list. And, earning money out of it is not everyone cups of tea.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, nothing to worried about it. If you want to see yourself in one of the top influencer lists, first you need to understand:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/the-beginners-guide-to-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>What is Influencer Marketing</strong></a><strong>?</strong></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-become-an-ideal-social-media-influencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to become a social media influencer</a>?</strong></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-create-your-influencer-marketing-strategy-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to create your influencer marketing strategy on social media?</a> </strong></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once you get an idea about it, then this post will be highly beneficial for you as here we are going to share how you can be a paid influencer. Yes, you have read it. You will learn how to earn money and fame altogether.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, here we go!</span>
<h2><b>Choose a Niche You’re Passionate About </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This we have been repeatedly saying in our old posts. Niche plays an important role in your influencer journey. Deciding what your passion is all about and on which topic you want to be excellent is the first factor to decide your success. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, in case you want to become a successful influencer, you need to find a niche that suits your personality. This something the one that you are passionate about. Something which you love to do and you have a good deal of knowledge and interest as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, just because someone is so famous in some field and you want to be like him or him won’t take you anywhere. For example, you like watching BB KI Vines starrer Bhuvan Bam and want to be as successful as him; doesn’t mean you need to follow the same niche as he is in. If he into making funny videos, but you like art, then your niche is ART. Or maybe you love food, and have a great deal of interest in different types of cuisines? Maybe you’re into fashion and are always aware of the latest styles and trends?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So take this niche methodology very seriously, and pick that you&#8217;re genuinely passionate about. </span>
<h2><b>Get A Business Account on Social Media Platforms</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are serious about being an Influencer, you need to create a business account on a social media platform like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important benefit of tuning into business account is that you will be able to boost your post or content quickly. Paid services really do help you to get recognition.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/busi.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18625 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/busi.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="339" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it helps to get access to insights. You’ll be able to see not only your follower demographics but also which posts are getting better engagement. You will also be able to see the days and times which give you the best engagement.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting followers demographically are very useful when it comes to pitching to brands for collaboration. Because the number of followers and your popularity speaks louder than your content.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/example-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18584 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/example-1.png" alt="" width="577" height="330" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you might have noticed various models and stars representing some brands over their social media platforms. This is all about influencer marketing as they promote those brands over their followers and influence them to buy them. </span>
<h2><b>Do Not Buy Followers</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the cheapest mistake people are doing these days. It may seem like the easiest way to get followers but that won’t last long. These easily bought followers won’t give you any benefit in your journey &#8211; <em>They Are Not Your Loyal Followers</em>.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/example-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18626 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Don´t-buy-fake-followers-2-800x445.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="253" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid followers are no good to you. If you want to become a social media influencer and make money, organic is the way to go. And, we agree this can’t happen overnight but there no easy road to success. Paid followers can be detrimental to your growth because these followers won’t be engaged enough.</span>
<h2><b>Reach Out to Private Communities, Groups, and Agencies</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that brands are looking for influencers with many followers who can be their brand ambassadors on social media platforms. They see at least 20,000 followers as a baseline. Also, they have teams or agencies to contact and searching for influencers. So, how they will reach you out? How do you get into consideration?</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ligroups1-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18627 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ligroups1-1.png" alt="" width="598" height="275" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, start involving with groups and agencies to get their recommendation. For example, if the fashion world interests you, try joining Facebook groups like the Fashion Brand Ambassador Group. These groups offer peer tips, advice, and trends discussion. You may also find brands posting job opportunities.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Start working on same and compile a list of influencer marketing agencies and brands that use influencer marketing. Make sure you are seen in the right places. Join private networks that promote participation in brand programs.</span>
<h2><b>Learn to Make Amazing/Valuable Content That Solves the Followers’ Problems</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know visual content taking over all the content strategies like ever before. Be it videos, well-written blogs, mesmerizing Instagram pictures, sharing a valuable content is all part of influencer’s job. It’s better if they create content solving their followers&#8217; queries in an elegant, exciting or new way. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about your niche audience, what they want or what exactly they are looking for, and then create a beautiful to give them what they want. Just do your research and then give it to them.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands are most interested in things they have never seen before or they want a unique idea, and that their competitors are not able to do. The more unique ideas you develop for content, the more brand recognition you’ll get. If you want to get paid as an influencer, you’ll need to prove you’re worth it to the marketer signing your check!</span>
<h2><b>Start Small with Free Collaborations in the Beginning</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be practical! Don’t expect to get the partnership with big brands just like that. Don’t try to jump straight into the world of paid influencers.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1_mOhB86UhikOgglWtGpXAGQ-1-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18628 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1_mOhB86UhikOgglWtGpXAGQ-1-1.png" alt="" width="506" height="325" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In your initial days, try to collaborate with smaller brands for FREE. There are many small enterprises or start-ups that are looking for brands ambassadors but can’t afford them due to money constraint.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can offer FREE promotion to their products. It will help both the parties in order to get recognition. Or you can use Promo code strategy to get the commission on every sale through content. There are ways to initiate the process. It depends on up to you how flexible you can be for your future goal.</span>
<h2><b>Think Like a Marketer</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be your career or business in a long run. Think like a marketer or businessman and plan your moves accordingly. For same, you need to educate yourself on what is trending these days and how people are using different ways to stand in the competition. Read more and more case studies. Try various <a href="https://digiperform.com/33-most-effective-social-media-marketing-tools-for-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social marketing tools</a> to prioritize your work. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn various online marketing tactics to increase your followership and how to use these tactics in your marketing strategies. Follow famous influencers, meet them in seminars, try to make contact and learn from them. If you want a success, you need to get educated on how professionals in the field do business.</span>
<h2><b>Know When to Turn Down Offers to Become a Brand Influencer</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t go for anything or everything. Money can be an enticing proposition, but being a brand influencer is a big responsibility. No brand would like to collaborate with the wrong influencer. Don’t go for negative promotion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, know the market value of an influencer in your niche. Don’t blindly accept the first offer to promote any brand on your social media platforms if you don’t know what your value in the market truly should be! </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, it’s better to make better decisions through shared experiences before raising your prices or creating rate sheets. </span>


<b><i>It’s not the end yet…….</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a successful brand ambassador often brings perks, cash, fame, the quality of living and the satisfaction of running your own business while doing something you love. With a little luck and a lot of determination, you too can leverage social media platforms to become a brand influencer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18581 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/inf-1.png" alt="" width="439" height="278" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An influencer is a person who has the credibility in a specific industry to impact the audience. Or An influencer has the access to a large following audience and has the capability to influence the audience within the reach. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But in this post, we would talk about how to create a social influencer marketing strategy. So, let’s buckle up your shoes as you are going to learn the various tactics to be on the top spot as an influencer on our favorite social media platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the key steps: </span>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>Define Your Target Audience</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For any action plan, you should know who is your target audience. What’s the point of any strategy if you are not aware of the category or nature of your audience fall into. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, for any successful social media influencer marketing strategy, you need to know who you are trying to influence. All it helps &#8211; to be specific. The more specific you will be while targeting your audience, easier it will be for you to be the kind of influencer that everyone would admire. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you are a lifestyle influencer, your target audience will be the one who has an interest in lifestyle products or services. It will include fashion, luxury, etc. And, if you talk about a fitness influencer, your target audience will be fitness freaks, not just everybody. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, Social media platforms have the ability to target the specifics especially Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. With these tools, your content will be more visible to the kind of audience you select during the campaigns. You can create ranges by focusing on different niches.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/target.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18582 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/target.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="387" /></a>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>Set Objectives</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you create an influencer marketing strategy for social media platforms, you first need to determine what you are trying to achieve. Your aim may be something small like gaining a set number of followers for your social media pages, or extra visitors to your website and signing up for a newsletter. But it needs to strategize.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever is your end objective, it should be sorted and cleared. Being an influencer if you are confused, then don’t expect your audience to understand what you are trying to convey on social platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, use right key actions or Call-To-Action buttons while creating your social media campaigns. Or, show the clear and neat message in your content. Transparency is always cherished by audiences.  </span>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>Prepare a Content Plan</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided who will be your target audience and sort with objectives, then it’s time to decide the general content topics that might interest your audience. For same, you need to create a content plan &#8211; <a href="https://digiperform.com/10-content-marketing-growth-hacks-that-will-double-your-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Content Strategy</strong></a>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should prepare a coordinated series of content that will not just only meet the needs of your audience but also entertain them. No one likes boring and outdated ways to know new things. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a great idea to keep yourself open to try to new ways to entertain your audience. And, it&#8217;s always great to set up a content calendar when you decide what content you need to create by what dates.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A content calendar helps you plan and coordinate the content you share with your target audience. It also helps you work in with the schedules of your content posted on social media platforms and share as per your strategy. You should try and ensure that you are always planning at least a month ahead. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>Collaborate With Your influencers to Produce Quality Content</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you start making a quality content calendar and share on your social media platforms, then it gets time to collaborate with existing influencers in your niche. Collaborating with already famous social media influencers is a big hype these days. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Musically’s (TikTok) musers are quite famous these days. Wannabe musers who want to be famous start collaborating with crowned musers. Even our wannabe be photographers and actors are following the same path by collaborating with existing influencers in their respective fields.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18556 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/muser.jpeg" alt="" width="437" height="291" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, quality content also plays a big role in this. For an influencer marketing campaign to be successful on social media platforms, you need quality content for your influencers to share. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The influencers may have followers who trust them, but the audience is not going to spend money simply because an influencer told them to. They are not fools. Nowadays, people believe in logic and Genuity. They don’t like to be fool around. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is already a lot of rubbish content on the internet. No matter how good you are,  your efforts will not remain relevant if you keep on sharing irrelevant content.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>Measure the Results of Your Social Media Campaigns</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately every effort asks for results. When you follow all the steps and your campaign gets over, you should analyze the success of your strategy. The success can be any form depending on your campaigns. It can be earning the number of followers, clicks, signs ups and so on.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have met your objective, it is time to re-evaluate things and possibly a new campaign with a higher objective. If you have failed to meet your objective, take a close look to try and determine what the problem was. Take stock and change your next campaign to see if you can improve on your results. You can use various <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-analytics-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media analytics tools</a> to see the insights of your social media campaigns. Your own social media platforms provide insights into your campaigns to help you evaluate your campaign/post success.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today getting millions of followers on social media is a hype and everyone wants to be the part of the Who’s Who list. Especially when we talk about the young generation, all they want to earn thousands of followers on their social media accounts (such as Instagram, Snapchat, Musically now TikTok) and relish the limelight.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18556 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/muser.jpeg" alt="" width="417" height="278" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But very few of them know that their same passion can lead them to be a famous Social Media Influencer as well. Yes, you have heard right!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being influencer doesn’t mean you need to be an actor, cricketer, model, etc. Even a young blogger whose passion is writing about Bollywood or a housewife who loves to cook different cuisines can be a renowned Social Media Influencer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Lifestyle blogger &#8211; <a href="https://www.missmalini.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miss Malini</a> &#8211; is one of the famous Indian influencers who is a great source for the latest Bollywood &amp; Indian TV news, celebrity gossip, fashion trends, beauty tips, and lifestyle updates. She is now a reputed Indian digital influencer, TV host, entrepreneur, and best-selling author.</span>
<a href="https://www.missmalini.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18557 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/miss-malini-blogger-india-fashion-bollywood-editorial-magazine-celebrity-mohitbhatia.in-shoot-mumbai-mohit-bhatia-photography-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="425" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major chunk of her success goes to the Social media platform. According to her, social media is the easiest way to reach out to millions of people when it is followed by the right content and marketing strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the <a href="https://digiperform.com/the-beginners-guide-to-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beginner’s Guide to Influencer Marketing</a>, we shared the basics about what is influencer marketing, who can be the influencer and how is influencer marketing effective? </span>
<a class="btn btn-default" title="Read more" href="https://digiperform.com/the-beginners-guide-to-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we will share how you can become a social media influencer. But before that, you need to understand why being a social media influencer is a big hit.</span>
<h2><b>Why do people want to become a social media influencer?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this is the best way if you want to be part of the fame business. Agree or not?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is the only platform that connects everyone with each other around the world and causing huge changes in culture and society. It’s not only breaking down communication barriers but fragmenting the media and connecting people like never before.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other way around, it is the easiest way to come into the limelight. Who doesn’t like to be known and acknowledged by ‘n’ number of followers? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, if you are desirable on the internet and share-worthy content, then there are high chances that you can be acknowledged by big brands to promote their product as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, one very known social media influencer named Saloni Chopra, who is famously known by the username RedHeadwayFarer on Instagram. Though she always been doing small TV projects she’s got more attention through feminist posts and critics over social media. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She has such loyal followers that Amazon India featured her as Fresh New Look #FreshNewLook in their advertisements. Now, she has been promoting various products of brands through her social media pages.   </span>

<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzdmWT07hvg" width="600" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This proves that Marketing Firms are fighting to work with top social media talents who promise them an access to their valuable audience and experiences that are usually reserved for celebrities. Even, entrepreneurs are ramping up famous influencers to scale their business and move into new territories.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why not be a social media influencer. Therefore, in this post, we help you to understand how you can become an ideal social media influencer by following these basic steps:</span>
<h2><b>Find Your Passion / Focus / Niche</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to become a social media influencer, you need to analyze what you love doing. You need to have a passion for the topic and zeal to explore. Therefore, you need to master the topic (niche) you choose to work on. Like those who love fashion write about fashion, who love automobiles will discuss automobiles, etc….</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to find your niche and master it. Start small and learn as much as you can about your desired niche through research and experimentation. Otherwise, it will go to waste!</span>
<h2><b>Choose your Favourite Social Media Platform</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a right media platform plays a big role in your success. Like, Instagram is the most common social media platform where 93% of social media influencer focus their photo generic content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Instagram gives a better result than any other platform. Though Instagram stats are high that doesn’t mean it’s the best platform for you.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to decide according to the content you would like to generate. For example, photography is your passion, the Instagram is the best place for you. But if you like to create short stories or movies, then YouTube is the best platform for you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Bhuvan Bam commonly known for BB Ki Vines is quite popular on YouTube for sharing hilarious content. He has an interest in sharing comical stories.</span>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqwUrj10mAEsqezcItqvwEw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18558 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-19-at-12.48.08-PM.png" alt="" width="511" height="328" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The logic is simple. All you need to understand your audience and kind of content you would like to share. According to them, choose your social media platform. </span>
<h2><b>Develop your Content Strategy and Share Valuable Content</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided on your niche and social media platform, all you need to need to implement a complete content strategy to keep your audience updated. And, the content should not be just like that. It should be valuable to your audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to implement a system for keeping on top of the latest news about your industry. Once you get updates, start sharing high-value influencer content with your audience via social media.  This brings trust &amp; value to your audience. People need to see you as a resource. Therefore you need to feed them with the latest news and happenings around the world. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your content organized for easy access so if someone asks a question, you can quickly grab content that provides an answer.</span>
<h2><b>Engage With Your Loyal Followers</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone appreciates the response. When your followers leave a question or comment on your posts or trying to contact you on the social media platform, take the time to acknowledge and respond to them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That can make them feel like they&#8217;re valued and that you sincerely want to help them. It will also help you develop a relationship with them.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even actors also understand the importance of staying in touch with their followers and answer them from time to time. Don’t trust me. One of the known Bollywood and web series actor Karanvir Sharma always take time to answer his followers. He is so humble that various hotel chains and other brands approach him to promote products just because of his loyal followers and humbleness. If he can do that, why not you?</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-19-at-12.52.04-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18559 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-19-at-12.52.04-PM.png" alt="" width="307" height="475" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, we understand, social media always have two sides of the coin. With positive you will come across of negative comments as well. Don’t get dishearten. As an influencer, expect that you’ll have your fair share of negative comments and criticisms. Make it a point to keep your cool and address them professionally.</span>
<h2><b>Evaluate &amp; Study Your Progress</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This step is crucial, especially if you’re looking to collaborate with brands for their influencer marketing campaigns since this is one of the things that brands look for in an influencer to partner with.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most social media channels give you insights and analytics to monitor your progress &#8212; things like demographics, reach, and engagement rate, that will show how quickly (or slowly) you’re building your audience. It will also shed light on which content formats get the highest engagement rates so that you can create more of these.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the few basics that you should try at the initial level if you won&#8217;t see yourself as a social media influencer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the period, try to <a href="https://digiperform.com/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-increase-your-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase your followers on social media</a> in a positive way and share valuable content as much as you can.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry we are in your rescue. Let’s start with step by step to understand influencer marketing with our free beginner&#8217;s guide to influencer marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>
<h2><b>What is Influencer Marketing?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influencer Marketing</a> is a type of marketing that aims to grab attention by using influential people to amplify a brand’s message and project it to a given audience.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple words, instead of marketing the product or services directly to the audience, the brands would hire, pay or incentivize a person of social influence to review, name-drop or associate with the brand.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the small-scaled brands are using influential stand-up comedians to promote their products like the way <a href="https://digiperform.com/interview-session-souled-store-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Souled Store</a> collaborated with Stand-up comedian Kenny Sebastian and AIB to promote their funky t-shirts in the respective audience.</span>
<h2><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-12.07.22-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18546 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-12.07.22-PM.png" alt="" width="358" height="418" /></b></a></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Why is Influencer Marketing Effective?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At a basic level, marketing is all about getting your message delivered to your audience or tied in with getting your plans to spread it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, broad communications (or advertising) was the favored strategy to accomplish these finishes. But now the ways have tuned into web directions.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best part of influencer marketing that helps brands to reach out to the local audience. An influencer can decide in what way they want to promote the product in their audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the audience looks for genuine reviews that can be related to them personally. Therefore influencer marketing comes very handy for brands if they want to target genuine customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When brands get influencer marketing right, they reap big returns. Consider these statistics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter users report a 2X increase in purchase intent when exposed to promotional content from influencers.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing content delivers 11X higher ROI than traditional forms of digital marketing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, businesses generate $6.50 for every $1 invested in influencer marketing.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Who are the Influencers?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When people think about influencers, they naturally imagine some top celebrity-type figures or TV actors. But influencers don’t necessarily have to be celebrities. They can be lifestyle followers, comedians, bloggers, industry experts, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They do, however, usually specialize in a particular niche and typically benefit from a large following on social media.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of social influencers come in the form of:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalists</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academics</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry Experts</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloggers/Vloggers</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides being influential to a lot of people, influencers are often different from the general public by the way in which they adopt new ideas and innovations.</span>
