			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever tried applying for a job but don’t know how to make a resume? If that’s the case, then this blog might be useful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are applying for different jobs, you might want to avoid submitting exactly the same resume to every employer. Different employers have different individual requirements, some may want to focus more on your work history, and others on your skills. It is important to know what type of resume to use in a specific situation.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h3 class="text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">What is a resume?</h3></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s know what a resume is. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><b>Résumé</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; comes from the French word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">résumer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meaning &#8216;to summarize&#8217;. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a formal document created by a person which contains their background, skills, accomplishments, and even previous jobs. It is submitted to your employers for them to have a glimpse of your background and decide if you are qualified for the position. </span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h3 class="text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">Types of resumes</h3></div></div></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s discuss the types of resumes. There are different types of resumes to choose from, it is important to know which one to choose because it gives you a better chance of getting accepted. Moreover, it helps you provide the information your employers need. Here are three main types of resumes. </span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h2 class="text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">1. Chronological resume</h2></div></div></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the most common type of resume and is considered the standard in most industries. A chronological resume focuses more on your work history. It is arranged in chronological order in which your most recent job is found at the top, followed by your previous ones below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers generally prefer this type of resume because it contains all their needed information and is presented in a short and concise manner. It shows your job history and the progression of your career over time. It is most beneficial for job applicants with a structured work history and a clear career path. When using this type of resume, make sure you have no sizable work gaps.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h2 class="text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">2. Functional resume</h2></div></div></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A functional resume is also known as a skill-based resume. It mainly focuses on your relevant </span><a href="https://www.fingerprintforsuccess.com/blog/hard-skills-vs-soft-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional hard skills and soft skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than your work history. The “relevant skills” section takes up the majority of your resume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are changing jobs but don&#8217;t know how to make your past position relevant to your new job, then this type of resume might be for you. This can also be advantageous when you have sizable gaps in your work history. Since this resume focuses more on the skills, it can also be useful to fresh graduates with no experience.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h2 class="text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">3. Combination resume</h2></div></div></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A combination resume is a hybrid resume that combines a reverse-chronological resume and a functional resume. It allows you to highlight both your professional skills and work experience since it focuses on both your skills and work history. There are two main advantages to a combination resume, it allows you to present a quick overview of your work history, and helps your employer know your skills and qualifications. </span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h2 class="text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">When to use a combination resume?</h2></div></div></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people prefer the two traditional resume formats mentioned above because it is straightforward and easy to make. A combination resume is very situational so you should use it when you:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are changing careers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have sizable employment gaps in your work history</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">And has a diverse range of skills and experiences. </span></li>
</ol>

		</div>
	</div>
<div class="vc_empty_space"   style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h2 class="text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">Conclusion</h2></div></div></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing which type of resume to use depends on your situation. To get a better chance of getting accepted, make sure you also do your research on the different resume templates and decide which </span><a href="https://www.resumenerd.com/resume-templates"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resume template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is right for you. Time is gold for most employers, which is why they prefer straightforward resumes, so remember to keep your resume concise and good luck on your job-seeking journey!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience of your product is essential, and not focusing on it enough will cause the product to fail. This is an issue that has affected many businesses, and it has caused them to shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will tell you about the five biggest UX mistakes that turn your users off. Knowing what these are will help you avoid making these mistakes and learn what you should not do when designing the UX of your product.</span></p>

<h3>5 Biggest UX Mistakes Turning Your Users Off</h3>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Using Responsive Design</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsive design is necessary, and you cannot avoid it. If your website doesn’t have a responsive design, then it will not be successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without responsive design, users will be irritated when using your product, and you need to make sure this doesn’t happen. People use various devices every day, and if your websites cannot be displayed on different devices and screen sizes, they will fail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a UX mistake that new <a href="https://www.tvisha.com/blog/difference-between-ui-and-uxwhich-comes-first">UX designers</a> can make, setting them up for failure. You need to know that responsive design is not a trend, and it needs to be a part of all of your designs. UX design consultant firms like </span><a href="https://clay.global/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will tell you how important this is and ask you to make it a fundamental part of UX design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already started designing your website and haven’t added responsive design, then you need to start again and add it in. If you don’t have experience doing this, hire UX design consultant firms and use their UX services to help you create the best designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never design your websites without making them responsive. You need to remember this and use it in all of your designs.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Using Carousels In Your Design</h4>
<p><a href="https://webflow.com/blog/carousel-slider-design-best-practices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have become a popular design trend, and designers are adding them to their website design without a good reason. This design trend doesn’t add value to the website that the user can benefit from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t need to be a carousel; you need to consider why you are adding something to the design and if it’s giving the user any value. Let’s focus on carousels in this article and use them as an example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the disadvantages of carousels in your website’s design.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They distract the user from the other content that is on the screen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user will need to navigate the carousel to find the information they want.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousels aren’t giving the user any value. The information can be presented in a different way that is less distracting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website’s design can look cluttered if the carousel isn’t in the right place.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would help if you looked at these issues when adding anything new to your website’s design. Don’t just add something because it might look good. Think about how it helps the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to use a carousel in the <a href="https://digiperform.com/importance-of-web-design-development-in-digital-marketing-strategy/">design</a>, you need to make it essential. Give users control, don’t make it automatic. Present information that users will want to know more about. This will cause them to click on the carousel and visit other pages of your website.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Thinking About The Mobile User Experience</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people use their mobiles to visit websites. This is why it’s essential to ensure your website’s <a href="https://digiperform.com/the-importance-of-user-experience-for-digital-marketing/">mobile user experience</a> is excellent. New designers can make this mistake, and it causes users to be frustrated and leave the website. When this happens, they will not return and instead use a different website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about what you should do when designing your website for mobile.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rearrange the content and elements on your website to make them easier to see on smaller screen sizes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make buttons larger, so users don’t have a hard time clicking them to navigate your website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove content that isn’t important. You have less space; you need to keep what the user is looking for and remove everything else.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify the navigation. Make it easier for people to navigate the website.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test your website on different screen sizes and improve to give users the best experience. If you need help designing for mobile, use the UX services that UX design agencies offer.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Discounting Usability</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design needs to be usable. You need to ensure that your design puts </span><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">usability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the visuals. If it doesn’t, this can cause people to have a bad experience when using your website and cause them to leave after a negative first impression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many products fail because they have poor usability. You need to make sure your website isn’t one of them. Understand who your users are and what they want from your product. This is what you should be focusing on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at similar products and identify how usable they are. Do they make it easier for users to achieve their goals? If they don’t, then why would people want to use them? Learn from this mistake and avoid it in your designs.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Simplifying</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/6-steps-to-write-a-perfect-website-design-brief-2/">Designers</a> need to simplify their designs. You need to keep what’s essential to the user and remove everything else. A cluttered design will cause users to leave the website, and you don’t want this happening to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out what users want and give them that. Everything else doesn’t need to be there. If it’s just taking up space and not giving users any value, why is it in your design?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing this requires understanding your users and what they want from your product. Research thoroughly before you start designing the UX of your website. This is how you can create great designs that people want to interact with.</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Customer call centres need to change. At least, that is, if we look at customer satisfaction rates over the last decade. In 2010,  global customer satisfaction with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/802285/global-contact-center-satisfaction-index/">private call centres was 75%</a>. Just ten years later, that figure drops to 71%.</p>
<p>Considering the advances in technology in the intervening time, this was an unexpected outcome. If anything, we expected customer satisfaction to improve. A close analysis of the statistics might indicate the reason for the decline.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, global customer satisfaction was just 68%. The 2020 figures, therefore, indicate that we did something correctly in 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What might that have been?</h3>
<p>For one thing, companies were managing the fallout of covid-19. They were scrambling to provide service by any means necessary without worrying about the bottom line. As a result, clients received access to more service consultants and also innovative measures like voice bots.</p>
<p>The bots made it possible to direct calls quickly and efficiently and answer simple questions. However,<a href="https://financesonline.com/chatbot-statistics/"> 59% of business owners</a> believe that chatbots struggle to understand the nuances of human communication.</p>
<p>The recognizable difference, therefore, is that the bots allowed companies to collate queries from several platforms. The client benefited by having one centralized support department irrespective of how they lodged their question.</p>
<p>The focus on customer support, providing a centralized omnichannel response, and appropriate use of technology raised customer satisfaction by 3% in one year. What makes this achievement impressive, however, is that this was the most brutal business year this millennium. However, with technology like <a href="https://getvoip.com/blog/business-phone-systems/">VoIP phone systems</a> businesses were able to take customer support to the next level and succeed.</p>
<p>Going forward, it makes sense for businesses to consider the benefits of adopting an omnichannel centralized approach. In this article, we’ll examine those advantages and see how <a href="https://supportyourapp.com/call-center-outsourcing/">professional support experts</a> might implement them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How Centralized, Omnichannel Customer Support May Benefit Your Organization</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>One-Stop Service</h4>
<p>Raise Your Hand if the following interaction sounds Familiar:</p>
<p><b>Client</b>: “Hi, my account number is 1245-4550-788. Please tell me what my installment this month is.”</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “I’m sorry, I’m in sales, and I don’t have access to that information. I can transfer you to accounts; please hold.”</p>
<p>The customer holds for a few minutes, and then the next consultant comes on the line:</p>
<p><b>Client</b>: “Hello, is those Accounts? My number is 1245-4550-788, and I need my installment for this month, please.”</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “ I’m sorry, you’re through to the switchboard. The accounts department is busy on another call. May I try someone else for you?”</p>
<p>With a big sigh, the customer says,” Yes.”  and waits for the next person to answer.</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “Good morning,  this is Joe; how may I help you?”</p>
<p><b>Client</b>: “Hi Joe,  are you in Accounts?”</p>
<p><b>Consultant</b>: “No,  I’m in Tech Support, but I was passing the Accounts department and answered the phone. Can I give them a message for you or get them to call you back?”</p>
<p>The conversation is typical of what many clients experience when companies silo departments. Each section is only responsible for a small aspect of service. They cannot assist the client with anything outside of that.</p>
<p>In our example, the client dealt with three consultants, none of whom could answer his question. With a centralized call center, however, the client would call one number, and the consultant would be able to assist him immediately. If the agent didn’t know the answer to the question, they’d find out and tell the client.</p>
<p>The upside for the client is that there’s no playing phone tag or endlessly repeating his details. The upside for the company is increased productivity because agents don’t deal with calls outside their ambit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Omnichannel Monitoring Keeps You Up to Date on Client Needs</h3>
<p>Clients today have several platforms from which to communicate. If you’re lucky, they’ll lodge complaints with your service line. When clients decide not to take this course, however, they have several outlets in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media pages</li>
<li>Online groups</li>
<li>Review sites</li>
<li>Forums</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies must monitor for mentions of their names online. They should then engage with the clients no matter what the platform is. Adopting a centralized approach makes it far simpler to collate these mentions and send out a consistent brand message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Final Notes</h3>
<p>Going forward, companies must act as cohesive units. It’s crucial to start blurring the distinction between departments, especially where the customer is concerned. Operating a centralized, omnichannel support center makes it easy for clients to get the assistance they need. They also boost company productivity.</p>

			<p>In this digital era, good access to content and data from online sources may be all you need to have the upper hand in the occupation you are in.</p>
<p>Web developers have come up with many strategies to ease access to information from the internet. One of the ways that clearly stands out is web scraping/crawling. With web crawlers, you can gather and analyze information faster, conveniently, and in a highly affordable manner.</p>
<p>You must not even purchase crawlers. You can make your own with methods such as python coding, browsers’ extension, or even use data extraction tools such as Zenscrape.</p>
<p>Despite the flexibility in creating/accessing crawlers and the benefits that web scraping offers, there are still hurdles when it comes to usage. There are sites that you can’t access even if you have crawlers. In some cases, you’ll only scrape information to a certain level.</p>
<p>Another important factor is captcha solving, if your scraping efforts aren’t able to go through it, you won’t get any data and you would be wasting your bandwidth. You can find a lot of comprehensive information on how to go around this issue <a href="https://proxyway.com/guides/how-to-bypass-captcha">by reading this guide</a>.</p>
<p>It is the work of the same web developers to create anti-scraping tools. With this, they make sure that they win either way (from the information owners and the information seekers). So, do you feel like the crawlers you have are not serving their intended purpose because of limited usage? We have good news for you- You can still go around all the obstacles that prevent you from crawling.</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss two easy techniques that you can use to beat anti-scraping. Let’s dive directly into them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. IP Address</h3>
<p>Your Internet Protocol address is like an identity that is held responsible for all activities that you perform on a site. Websites will track your IP if they notice some weird behavior and try to establish if the activities under your IP are human or robotic. If your IP address makes very many requests simultaneously within a particular period (which is obviously what a scraping bot will do), the website may block it.</p>
<p>So, when are your scraping activities likely to be suspected and blocked?</p>
<p>• When you send too many requests within a very short period- Websites assume that humans are generally slower and that there is a certain number of requests they are supposed to send in a given period.</p>
<p>Solution: Reduce the request you send in a given period. Leverage techniques such as ‘sleep’ function or increasing waiting time between two requests.</p>
<p>• When you are always visiting a website at the same time- Again, websites don’t expect humans to clock some level of accuracy and consistency and hence will treat highly accurate and consistently timed activities as scraping.</p>
<p>Solution: Make the scraping speed random</p>
<p>• Consistent requests from varying IPs- Even if your crawler uses various IPs, the activities/requests should not be timed at a particular time as this will be recognized by advanced anti-scraping techniques.</p>
<p>Solution: Use rotating IPs with random scraping speeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Captchas</h3>
<p>‘Captcha’ is the contraction of ‘Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers And Humans Apart. The Captcha is the kind of image that prompts you to do certain tasks such as clicking particular items or doing some calculations in order to access the content of a page.</p>
<p>Captchas’ main aim is to dictate tasks that only humans can tackle and not robots.</p>
<p>The use of Captchas has evolved to be one of the most effective anti-scraping techniques for website owners. Although it has been hard for web crawlers to pass this obstacle in the past, now there is an open-source tool that you can use to bypass all Captcha challenges when using crawlers.</p>
<p>The open-source tool, however, is not one of the easiest to create. It requires high proficiency in programming.</p>
<p>Another way people use to beat Captcha obstacles is making feature libraries that enable the creation of image recognition techniques using high-end learning or machine skills. Again, this may not be suitable for you and that’s why you still need a better solution.</p>
<p>The most promising and easiest way to beat anti-scraping when you are not the person who will spend hours and hours coding is simply reducing your scraping activities. This way, you’ll trick the anti-scraping features not to focus on your scraping tools. Eventually, the suspicion will be over and you’ll be able to crawl the website without any limitations.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>We hope you have enjoyed this post and now know how you can beat anti-scraping and proceed with your information crawling as normal. No matter how fun solving captchas automatically may look to you, it requires very advanced skills and unless you are the finest in the game, you should stick to the IPs tricks.</p>

			<p>One of the best ways of achieving excellent customer retention rates and boosting your sales performance is to be able to offer subscriptions.</p>
<p>Customers like the option to be able to subscribe to the services and products that they want on a regular basis and that is why you need to know which payment platform to use if you want to offer <a href="https://razorpay.com/subscriptions/">subscriptions.</a></p>
<p>Here is a look at the top-rated payment platforms that offer a recurring billing facility and some of the main features that help them to stand out.</p>
<h3>Razorpay</h3>
<p>Flexibility is one of the primary benefits associated with using Razorpay as they allow you the ability to easily instigate recurring payments using the UPI AutoPay feature.</p>
<p>Another good reason why Razorpay compares well against many of its rivals in that it offers widespread compatibility with the majority of leading UPI apps.</p>
<p>The transaction fees for processing these recurring payments are mainly 2% for Indian debit cards and credit cards.</p>
<p>The same rate applies to bank payments or if the customer wants to use a <a href="https://razorpay.com/upi/">UPI</a> of digital wallet option.</p>
<h3>LotusPay</h3>
<p>A feature of the LotusPay dashboard is how easy it is to use. This means that you should be able to manage your subscriptions and plans without needing to get too technical.</p>
<p>The majority of features are fully automated and you have the ability to create generic plans that vary in amounts and frequency, giving you a good degree of flexibility.</p>
<h3>PayTM</h3>
<p>What you will discover with the PayTM payment gateway is that you can generate subscription payment flows without the need to go through the repurchasing process again each time.</p>
<p>This is a feature that is particularly relevant if you are offering products that are being consumed on a daily basis and you want the ability to collect payments as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
<h3>PayPal</h3>
<p>You can’t ignore PayPal when talking about subscription payment platforms as it is such a dominant force in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>It is tried and tested when it comes to allowing you the ability to collect payments for memberships and other subscription options.</p>
<p>PayPal makes it easy to manage your recurring payments and you can use the options available to adjust billing frequency and intervals to your own requirements.</p>
<p>The fees charged by this global giant reflect their dominance and it is unlikely to be the cheapest provider you can find in the market.</p>
<h3>CCAvenues</h3>
<p>This provider promises to deliver an automated subscription service that aligns with your specific business needs.</p>
<p>You can craft your subscription plan around your own unique business requirements and the charges you incur for this service will be based on the number of users you bill in each cycle.</p>
<p>A useful option available with this provider is the chance to offer customers a trial period with the ability to automatically opt-in once the trial period comes to an end.</p>
<p>Being able to compare these sites should allow you to pick the options that are most important to your business and start collecting regular payments as seamlessly and easily as possible.</p>
<p>It is well worth getting right, as offering the right subscription options should help you close the sale.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, like every other process, healthcare marketing is far from easy, especially when you’re dealing with 21st-century</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> customers. <a href="https://www.goodhire.com/resources/articles/horrible-bosses-survey/">like this piece which includes data points on healthcare</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, we have a list of the top healthcare marketing tips for 2021 right here for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From positioning your marketing efforts for guaranteed success to improvising your </span><a href="https://www.finnpartners.com/sector/health/"><span style="font-weight: 400">patient engagement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> plans, these tips are sure to help you.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Educational Content Marketing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want to get smart with your healthcare marketing, there’s no better place to start than educational content. Once you start appeasing the information appetite of your visitors and educate them as much as possible, you’ll convert them into customers successfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there’s one glaringly obvious fact of 2021, it’s that content rules. Regardless of the niche, you specialize in within the healthcare industry, your reality is reaching the audience who will buy your products and service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the same 21st-century</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> audience that will search the net for information before they interact and purchase from a vendor. This is especially true for healthcare customers, who seek complete information on new diagnostic and treatment options, technological advancements, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here is where you can strengthen your healthcare marketing game plan: create stellar content and establish your expertise in the industry right before your audience. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Responsive and Proactive Website</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing makes new patients walk faster through your door than a highly responsive website. A web design that prioritizes proactive action and response to enhance the online experience for visitors is sure to convert them into clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But do you know what a responsive website is? It’s one that readjusts the screen size automatically according to device type. Regardless of whether a visitor is accessing the website from a phone, a tablet, a laptop or desktop; their experience must be the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, Google prizes user experience and gives a competitive edge to those websites that optimize their site for mobile users. Hence, a responsive site is surely going to boost your healthcare marketing but also ensure that your imagery and content load speedily on mobile devices. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. SEO for More Leads</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One fine way of bringing your healthcare business to the top of the search engines is search engine optimization. Many businesses tend to underestimate this aspect and assume that using terms like “healthcare practice” is enough to rank at the top on Google. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact is that SEO is a far more complex thing and requires a variety of phrases and keywords to make Google recognize you as the top business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this healthcare marketing aspect, you must hire a team of SEO experts who will use pertinent, relevant, and proper healthcare-based terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not just know them though: it is also crucial to optimally use the correct terms organically throughout your content. Readability is a priority for Google and if you lack in it, you can’t expect top ranking. As part of your healthcare marketing strategy, remember to work on the following SEO practices:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Including a couple of backlinks from elite health sites</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Including links that lead visitors back to each page on your official website</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Sitemap and site index management</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Website submission to Google</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Google My Business- Listing your website here</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Video Marketing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The healthcare businesses in 2021 cannot find a better tool than video marketing. It is, without doubt, the best channel healthcare marketers can use for increasing awareness and trust in their brand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For visitor and patient engagement, you cannot find a more steadfast tool than video. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A healthcare marketer in 2021 should make video marketing the backbone of their marketing plan. You can create video ads as short as ten seconds for channels like YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could also create an entire channel of your own to promote your brand’s visions. Regardless of the size of your campaign, be sure to add video marketing is the top technique of your marketing strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Video is your best tool for personalizing your healthcare brand and making it a relatable entity for your audience. By doing so, you will successfully eliminate the intimidation that people naturally feel towards new medical equipment, medicines, treatment options, and new doctors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your video must have quantity and quality both: there’s no compromising here and getting good content out consistently is an absolute must for business. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Implement Multichannel Approaches</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you familiar with omnichannel approaches? If you are then you should make that initiative a primary approach for your healthcare marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are not aware, then it is crucial to educate yourself and your marketing team on omnichannel initiatives and implement them FAST. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You must endeavor to make as many channels of your business available as possible to encourage patients and reduce their friction online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To this end, establish contact forms, online chatting mediums, and prominent display of contact numbers, etc. to make accessibility easy for visitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2021, you have a wide range of multichannel options available, including chatbots and others. Using them will guarantee a unique interactive experience for your customers and enhance their engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For both your mobile and web visitors, you must strive to provide multiple touchpoint options to them. Do you know why a multi-medium approach is necessary? The fact is that in 2021, every person enjoys a different engagement channel online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some love using Facebook pages for their concerns, others go straight to Twitter while others love conversing with chatbots. This is why keeping multiple channels active to represent your business is highly imperative to cater to the different preferences of the visitors. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless of what industry niche you deal with, having a competitive, updated, and proactive healthcare marketing plan is necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, with all the technological advancements, healthcare businesses now have a variety of tools they can use to bring more patients through their doors and more products and services sell out. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s common knowledge that the global gaming industry is booming. Global revenue almost hit $200 billion in 2021 – similar to the GDP of a medium-sized country like Greece – and it is expected to keep growing across the 2020s. Beyond the current popularity of gaming in and of itself, there are many reasons to believe this growth can be sustained, not least the rise of virtual reality and the concept of the metaverse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, while gaming is booming, it should be said that not every release can be a Fortnite or Minecraft. For instance, the Apple App Store currently </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268251/number-of-apps-in-the-itunes-app-store-since-2008/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has over one million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gaming applications. It’s a crowded market, and that means there are going to be winners and losers. Unfortunately, there’s going to be more of the latter than the former. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-39545 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-9-300x300.jpg" alt="Raid game " width="505" height="505" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-9-300x300.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-9-150x150.jpg 150w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-9-400x400.jpg 400w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-9-75x75.jpg 75w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-9-460x460.jpg 460w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-9.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are plenty of winners in this market. Consider the fortune of Josh Wardle, who created the simple Worlde game. He did it just for fun and created Wordle in a matter of days, and it soon became a viral global hit. Wardle </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wordle-creator-explains-why-he-sold-to-the-new-york-times/1100-6501982/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold the rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the game to the New York Times for $1 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you have created a great game, how do you make it stand out ahead of the competition? It’s not always easy, and to be honest, you’ll need some good fortune. But there are certain rules to abide by, which can maximize exposure and at least give your game every chance of success. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. A Game is a Startup</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren’t Ubisoft, Nintendo, Activision or one of the other big game developers, then you must treat your game like you would a startup business. In the development phase, that means asking yourself questions like, what need does this game fill? Is there a market for it? What type of person would play it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Make Sure It Has a USP (Unique Selling Point)</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a game is a type of artistic expression, so the rules of having a unique selling point are broader than other products. Nevertheless, your game needs to have a clear identity, a hook for you to market to your audience. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Social Media is Key</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words “gaming” and “community” go hand in hand these days. And it’s not enough to hope that it builds organically. If you take a game like Raid: Shadow Legends, one of the world’s most popular </span><a href="https://plarium.com/en/games/genre/multiplayer-games/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiplayer games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its presence – both official and unofficial – is all over social media platforms like Twitter, Twitch and YouTube. Much of that is to do with the popularity of the game, but it’s also due to the fact that its creators were able to instil a sense of community around the players. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Get Technical</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have experience marketing a startup online, you’ll know that SEO tactics are key to helping people find your product. Obviously, this can help with a game, too. However, there are some optimisation tactics unique to gaming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, there is </span><a href="https://appradar.com/academy/what-is-app-store-optimization-aso"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the practice of AS0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (App Store Optimisation). Similar in principle to SEO, it’s all about getting more visibility for your title on the app stores. You may need to hire an expert to do this, but it could pay dividends. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. Influencer Reachout </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you agree with it or not, so-called influencers can be integral to the success of any product these days. And the gaming industry has very powerful influencers, many of whom ply their trade on Twitch and YouTube. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is that they will showcase your game to their followers, perhaps by playing a demo version or providing previews in a stream. As you might expect, those with millions of followers won’t come cheap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can sponsor those streamers with 1000s of followers for relatively small fees, and that can get the ball rolling. While some might use </span><a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-use-affiliate-marketing-to-grow-your-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">affiliate marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, gaming has a unique relationship with influencers that might be more effective. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>6. Get Real About Pricing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps one of the hardest things in this current climate is not getting people to play your game but rather getting people to pay for your game. You’ll obviously value your product, but it’s hard to convince people to pay for it. Many games offer basic free versions or follow the freemium model, where revenue is made through in-game purchases. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. Start Early</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of games start marketing before they are finished. Take the example of CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077, which was talked about for the best part of a decade before its release in December 2020. You can release screenshots of your game, little teasers that help create anticipation as you build your audience. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>8. Don’t Be Afraid to Change</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, creating a game is an art form, and an artist can be reluctant to change their work. However, it is still a product, and you should, therefore, listen to feedback. Traditionally, changing a game (or something like a movie) after testing is viewed as a problem, but it needn’t be a fundamental one. A few tweaks after getting some expert feedback might be all you need to send your game to the top. </span></p>

			<p>All financial advisors want to find new clients.  Not only do they want to find the clients, but they also want them to be their clients for the long term.  Taking the time to do some research, and try some new things may make your heart skip a beat, but that is not a bad thing!  Stepping outside of one’s comfort zone can have a big payoff in the end.</p>
<p>Is it hard to believe that going small can pay off big?  It can.  Read on to understand what that means and how it can help you.  There are also several other ideas to help not only find new clients but also maintain these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064557/https://www.theadvisorcoach.com/27-financial-advisor-marketing-ideas--strategies-that-work.html">new financial advisory clients</a> for the long term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Think Small to Go Big</h3>
<p>Sometimes financial advisors think in order to get new clients, they need to expand their knowledge and base.  This is not true.  In order to get new clients, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064557/https://money.usnews.com/financial-advisors/articles/how-financial-advisors-can-build-their-client-base-and-keep-them-engaged">choose targets that fit</a>.  When an advisor hones in on specifics, people who are looking for a particular type of advisor will have success, as opposed to dabbling in many different areas.</p>
<p>Financial advisors can choose specific areas in a variety of areas.  Some may want to focus on people within a certain mileage away from where the advisor is located.  Others may want to focus on those clients who own their own businesses.   Some advisors may want to focus on the age of the clients.  The advantage is that a financial advisor can custom-create their specialty and focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Early Risers or Night Owls</h3>
<p>A financial advisor can take advantage of using the hours in the day to their advantage.  The regular workday will be filled with meetings, phone calls, and working with clients.  However, a financial advisor can take a small amount of time either first thing in the morning or later in the evening to get a step ahead of other advisors seeking and maintaining new clients.</p>
<p>Creating lists of what needs to be accomplished – by it short or long-term – is something that does not take a lot of time to complete. Creating these lists at night prior to bed is a great use of time.  It is a simple task to accomplish, and it does not take time away from your core work hours during the day.</p>
<p>It does, however, allow an advisor to get things on paper for the day or week ahead.  The same can be done for those who prefer to get up early and take a short amount of time to work on their lists.</p>
<p>Sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee while working on the to-do list for the week ahead is a great use of time and allows an advisor to work on attracting new clients. They can then use that core time during the day to put those plans into place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Constructive Feedback is Good</h3>
<p>That may be a difficult pill to swallow, but it is true.  There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064557/https://personalexcellence.co/blog/why-criticism-is-good/">several reasons constructive feedback can actually help</a> grow and maintain a client base.  One of the biggest things with this type of feedback is the ability of a financial advisor to see things from a different perspective.</p>
<p>This may allow you to rework a plan in place for a client or to make long-term improvements that can benefit many other clients.  It is about improvement; as times change, it is important to roll with changes. Adaptability can mean longevity in the financial advisory world.</p>
<p>Feedback can also be a great way to motivate someone.  If a client gives you feedback that a certain task is taking longer than they expected it to be completed, this may result in the advisor getting a motivational boost to get up and going to accomplish the task at hand.</p>
<p>As a possible positive result of this added motivation source, the client can potentially share with other prospective clients how the advisor listened to the concerns, made adjustments, and as a result – felt heard and valued.  Again, constructive feedback can work to your advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Be a Social Butterfly</h3>
<p>It is not okay to accept the belief that if someone is really interested in having someone as their advisor, the potential client will always reach out first.  This is why, in order to attract and then keep new clients, a financial advisor must always be visible in a social way.</p>
<p>There are many different methods and mediums to accomplish this.  First, when contacting people, if an advisor does not speak directly with the client, always leave a message.  It helps to convey the importance of the call, and it also tells the client you are focused on them.</p>
<p>Another way to keep the lines of communication open is through the mail.  This does not mean standard mailings and flyers. Get to know the client – their interests, passions, and more – and send them mail that is tailored to their own interests.  Again, this shows the client that you are paying attention to the small details in their lives.</p>
<p>If an advisor can pick up on small, social details, imagine the detail and planning that would be put into financial services through this advisor.  For the ultimate cherry on top, go with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064557/https://www.business2community.com/strategy/the-power-of-handwritten-notes-in-business-02279876#:~:text=Writing%20a%20handwritten%20note%20is,time%20to%20meet%20their%20needs.">hand-written note or letter to clients</a>.  Yes, it might be easier to type something, print it, and sign it, but when someone makes the effort to handwrite something to a client, nothing can beat that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Get Out of Your Comfort Zone: Try Something New</h3>
<p>Do not be afraid to try something new.  If things were perfect as-is, that would mean you would have a successful, wide-reaching financial advisory with a strong foundation of long-term clients and a steady trail of new clients as well.  However, that is not the case.  Taking the time to step outside of your comfort zone can have a big payoff in the end.</p>
<p>Start simple.  Build on the knowledge of what works and does not work.  Also, do not expect changes overnight.  Be patient.  Know that with the dedication to revised plans and the execution of them, attracting and maintaining new clients is within your reach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">

			<p>It’s hard to stick to schedules and strict discipline when you’re in the office from call to call. It’s even harder if you’ve chosen the hard path of freelancing. On the one hand, you are your own boss, but on the other – it’s so easy to slip into laziness when no one is above you. And it turns out that the pluses sometimes turn into minuses. But who will help the freelancer, but himself? Unless there’s some sensible advice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Study your biorhythms</h3>
<p>Learn about the strengths and weaknesses of your health, personal physical features. For example, many people cannot work without inspiration or do the same monotonous work for a long period of time.</p>
<p>There is no need to break yourself, it is useless and unproductive. Just know as many of your peculiarities as you can and take them into account. After all, you can do the work and please yourself.</p>
<p>Try to alternate different activities or even different projects to switch from one to another. Look for ways to motivate yourself or cheer yourself up if it plays an important role in whether or not you can work. Look for ways to approach yourself. It will be more comfortable than living according to the rigid schedule that the office dictates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Don’t let yourself be idle all-day</h3>
<p>You have to work almost every day. You may do less work than usual during periods of fatigue and emotional downturns, but that’s a good thing, too. Your pay depends on how much work you can pull off, so weeks of idleness and even days are not for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Eliminate Gadgets</h3>
<p>Nothing distracts from work more than another funny video, interesting article, or correspondence with a friend. All of these things are great, but after work, not instead of work. Can’t control yourself? Turn off your phone and take it into another room. Take concrete steps to eliminate gadgets for the duration of work, don’t rely on willpower, it rarely works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Rest only after work</h3>
<p>Of course, sometimes you have the right to have a day off. But if today is your working day, don’t even think about putting things off! You know yourself that this will not end well. So make a rule: you have the right to a proper rest only after you have done all the work for the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Start with the Hardest Part</h3>
<p>This will at least cheer you up after the job is done. In addition, it will be easier to get the job done while you’re not tired and full of energy. This is a fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Don’t be Distracted by Nonsense</h3>
<p>If you take on a particular case, try to stick to it. Do not jump from one thing to another, do not let your thoughts get confused. Keep your tasks in order if there are many of them. Use a timer if you don’t feel time.</p>
<p>Try different techniques, for example, you can allocate 45 minutes to work on one project, then rest for 15 minutes and only then take up the next. Look for your own style of work that will help you cope with things more easily. Use <a href="https://www.monitask.com/en/home/online-timesheets">online timesheet</a> software to track and analyze your day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Take Breaks</h3>
<p>It is clear that no one can work many hours in a row, all need to allocate a few minutes to rest between cases. Approach it consciously. Do not start watching a TV series during a break, do not plan meetings for this time. Allocate yourself no more than half an hour. And it’s better to warm up or lie quietly on the couch in silence to give your mind and body a chance to rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Don’t eat heavy foods before bedtime, don’t drink coffee or energy drinks</h3>
<p>It is clear that it is better to exclude all harmful things from your life altogether. And, of course, it can be too difficult to do it. Try to at least limit the consumption of junk in the evening, because bad sleep and insomnia can destroy all your plans for the new day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Watch how you feel</h3>
<p>Do not allow yourself to overexert yourself, even if you have a rush of inspiration, and it seems that on this very day you are ready to move mountains. Remember that after the feats of labor you still will be covered with withdrawal. Everyone has downs and ups, try to stick to the golden mean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Motivate yourself</h3>
<p>You are an adult, and since you have taken on such responsibilities as working for yourself or outside the office, it means that you have assessed your strengths and capabilities. Remember why and why you have chosen the life of a “free bird,” and this should motivate and discipline you. It is not a bad thing if you remember from time to time what you will lose if you cannot cope with laziness, cravings, and unwillingness to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>10. Create an Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Put nature sounds in the background, and spray scents that promote concentration. If you can’t feel collected, try changing into formal clothes. Set yourself up for work when it gets lazy and boring.</p>
<p>And, of course, keep your room and workplace clean. Not only do visual noise and garbage distract you purely psychologically, destroying the working mood, but also in a mess, you will spend too much time searching for the necessary notes and items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11. Rest</h3>
<p>Sometimes you need to allow yourself to getaway. Go to a meeting with friends on your day off, escape to the other side of town or to the countryside, take up a hobby or read an interesting book that you haven’t had time for.</p>
<p>Both at work and on vacation, you are your own boss. The main thing is that vacation really recharges you and gives you inspiration for another work period.</p>
