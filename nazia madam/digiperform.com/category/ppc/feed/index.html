			<p><strong>1. What is PPC marketing?</strong></p>
<p>PPC (Pay Per Click) is a way to drive and turn traffic to a website through Search engines and partner websites. It is a type of internet marketing which involves advertisers paying a fee each time their ads are clicked, the advertisers only have to pay if a visitor visits or clicks on their ads.</p>
<p><strong>2. Describe AdWords in brief?</strong></p>
<p>Adwords is an online procedure by Google to help businesses promote their products and services through search engines and associated websites. Through certain defined Adwords, you can place a text ad that appears when somebody searches for terms or phrases associated with your services or product.</p>
<p><strong>3. Explain how Adwords work?</strong></p>
<p>The whole Adwords system is based on bids and proposals. If you place a higher bidding price, definitely your ads are going to appear on the top of the search engine result pages. And as stated we all know that Adwords works on clicks which means you only have to pay the bidding or proposed amount if a person clicks on your ad.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which settings you cannot change after an Ad account is created?</strong></p>
<p>The Currency and Time Zone settings cannot be changed or edited after creating an ad account.</p>
<p><strong>5. What is Quality Score?</strong></p>
<p>Quality Score is an algorithm that is calculated for each keyword between 1 to 10. The Quality Score defines the quality of keywords compared with Ads and Landing Page. This algorithm is used to calculate the AdRank, which is used to calculate the position your ads would be placed.</p>
<p><strong>6. What is the impact of the Quality score on CPC and Ad Position?</strong></p>
<p>Quality Score is inversely proportional to CPC and directly proportional to Ad Position. That means higher the QS the benefit would be lower cost and higher ad position.</p>
<p><strong>7. What is Actual CPC?</strong></p>
<p>It is the actual cost of a click for an advertiser in an auction. The actual CPC is calculated in real-time making it nearly impossible to calculate the Actual CPC, but we can calculate the Avg. CPC.</p>
<p>Actual CPC = (AdRank to Beat/QS)+$0.01</p>
<p><strong>8. What Kind of Quality Score can you achieve for keywords?</strong></p>
<p>In my past campaigns, I was able to achieve a QS ranging from 7 – 10, but definitely, I can advance the quality score by using optimization techniques in ad campaigning.</p>
<p><strong>9. What are the Factors which affect Quality Score?</strong></p>
<p>Quality Score depends on the following logarithms</p>
<ul>
<li>CTR of the Keyword</li>
<li>The significance of Keywords and Ads</li>
<li>Landing Page Quality</li>
<li>Historic Account Data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. How can you Improve Conversion Rates?</strong></p>
<p>Conversion rates can be improved by creating ads that match rightly with the keywords and by creating compactly themed ad groups so that we can get targeted users to the best landing page.</p>
<p>By improving the Landing Page quality, also the conversions can be improved.</p>
<p><strong>11. Can PPC Advertising affect the ranking of websites on search engines?</strong></p>
<p>No, not possible as the Search Engines never mix them. Google and other search engines rank both organic and PPC results separately.</p>
<p><strong>12. Can you tell me the limit of the character used for PPC Ads?</strong></p>
<p>Expanded Text Ads limit the uses as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 Characters – Headline 1</li>
<li>30 Characters – Headline 2</li>
<li>80 characters – Descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard Ads has the limitation of a maximum of 25 for headlines 1 and 2 combined. 70 for descriptions</p>
<p><strong>13. What is an Invalid Click and how does Google determines the invalid clicks?</strong></p>
<p>Invalid clicks are fake clicks, termed unintentional and malicious software clicks. Google has a refined mechanism and algorithms to automatically detect and filter invalid clicks from the users&#8217; accounts.</p>
<p><strong>14. What are PLA Ads (Shopping Ads)?</strong></p>
<p>PLA (Product Listing Ads), is an ad strategy used to advertise product ads on Google search and associated partners. This campaign is also called a Shopping campaign mostly since it is mostly used by E-commerce websites.</p>
<p><strong>15. What is meant by Converted Clicks?</strong></p>
<p>Converted click is a metric that tracks the total no of clicks which resulted in conversions. This metric is criticized and not entertained by Google.</p>

			<p><strong>1. What is the Re-marketing Audience and how to generate this list?</strong></p>
<p>The re-marketing audience is the users who visit our websites, by using the Google remarketing tag on our website, we can add the users we wish to our audience list.</p>
<p><strong>2. When can the CPV be charged for an in-stream ad for a video of 60 seconds in length?</strong></p>
<p>A CPV can only be charged If the user watches at least 30 seconds of the published video.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is meant by Search Terms?</strong></p>
<p>Search Terms are the exact keywords for which your ads were triggered or generated.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is meant by Price Extensions?</strong></p>
<p>Price extensions are a new format of extension, intended to display the price of the relevant products.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are Affiliate Locations Extensions (ALEs)?</strong></p>
<p>ALEs are special extensions that link the location. These extensions are useful for brands to display the names of retail stores where the product is available offline.</p>
<p><strong>6. How will you manage the Google Quality Score?</strong></p>
<p>Google’s Quality Score is based on three things:</p>
<p>1- keywords</p>
<p>2-ad text</p>
<p>3- landing page relevance.</p>
<p>To maintain the highest score possible, it’s best to use fewer keywords and targeted ad groups. This way, we can write more targeted copy that will more likely find its position. PPC experts should be well-known with Quality Scores, how they work and how they improve the quality (with all these in mind sometimes, you may not even want to focus on Quality scores.)</p>
<p><strong>7. Can you explain how the Google auction works?</strong></p>
<p>Digiperform &#8211; Google Auction works</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40034" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blog-300x73.png" alt="Digiperform - Google Auction works" width="399" height="97" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blog-300x73.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blog.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>The auction process goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user enters a search, AdWord pulls out all the ads with relevant keywords matching that particular search.</li>
<li>From these ads, those which are not eligible, such as ads that target a different country or specific ads that have been disapproved, will be ignored.</li>
<li>From the ads remaining, only those with a high enough Ad Rank will be shown as results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since It’s a crucial stage of your campaign, make sure anyone who is involved with it knows the process and how to get the most out of it.</p>
<p><strong>8. How does Ad Rank affect the cost per click (CPC)</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to charging the CPC (the actual amount you’re charged per click), at the most you will end up paying the minimum amount required to hold your ad on the position.</p>
<p>In the Search Network, ads that appear above the search results generally have a higher CPC than those that appear below the results.</p>
<p><strong>9. What is click-through rate (CTR), and how is it calculated?</strong></p>
<p>The Click-through rate (CTR) is a ratio that shows how many people are clicking on your ad after seeing it. It is calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions. The total number of clicks is divided by the total number of impressions = click-through rate.</p>

			<p><strong>1. What are some things you can do using the Google AdWords API, and would you recommend using it?</strong></p>
<p>While the AdWords API offers a variety of tools and functions. It&#8217;s highly recommended that it should only be used by those with dedicated business services and needs that can’t be met through other AdWords tools. It should always be ensured and kept in mind to hire an expert who knows when to call in the API — and when not to.</p>
<p><strong>2. What third-party tools do you use for keyword discovery?</strong></p>
<p>Outside of Google’s own search query, there are plenty of tools to help discover new and related keywords. A few of them are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>3. Why is it recommended to separate Display Network campaigns from Search Network campaigns?</strong></p>
<p>The answer may vary by campaign, as Google explains that different campaign settings can be more effective on different networks.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is the On-Schedule Indicator (OSI)?</strong></p>
<p>The On-schedule indicator takes the traffic-shaped ad server goals into account and will represent a more accurate measure of the delivery status. It is recommended for networks that are enabled to pace based on expected traffic,</p>
<p><strong>5. How long should advertisers wait after creating a new display campaign before analyzing its performance?</strong></p>
<p>As Google recommends it should be for two to three weeks. But it depends from campaign to campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. What do manage placements allow advertisers to do?</strong></p>
<p>The managed placement allows the advertisers to Bid differently for specific placements on the Google Display Network.</p>
<p><strong>7. What are the benefits of remarketing?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Targeting users when they’re most likely to buy.</li>
<li>Lists are created for specific purposes.</li>
<li>Large-scale reach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Is my site well equipped to handle tracking requirements to ensure that remarketing campaign works?</strong></p>
<p>In order to know whether your site is well equipped to handle tracking requirements, you should ensure that the site is able to support the required pixels or codes, even before you begin your remarketing campaign.</p>
<p><strong>9. What are the most important KPIs to measure success?</strong></p>
<p>Remarketing, like any other campaign, comes with a set of metrics to keep track of. These include CTR, cost per click (CPC), effective cost per acquisition (eCPM) and return on investment (ROI). Before you start, make sure you know what your goal is and which key performance indicators (KPIs) best reflects it.</p>
<p><strong>10. What types of remarketing are there, and which is best for my campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Remarketing is not a size that fits all the users, within the ad type itself, there are many options including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site remarketing.</li>
<li>Search remarketing.</li>
<li>Email remarketing.</li>
<li>Social media remarketing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. Which audience segment should I target?</strong></p>
<p>Once you decide on the type of remarketing, the next step is choosing a segment. As an expert, you should be able to tell the difference between general visitors, specific product visitors, previous customers etc. and which one is the most appropriate process applicable for the given campaign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are carving out a long-term digital marketing strategy for your business, SEO serves as the base of it. Without investing in SEO, you can’t expect long-term results. But SEO takes time &#8212; sometimes three months, sometimes a little more than that, and some industries even require a year-long investment to rank on Google.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone looking for instant results, or boost visibility in a competitive niche when top results are dominated by high-authority sites, PPC is the best option. In exchange for a few bucks, you can acquire the top spot on Google.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds easy? It isn’t! Running successful PPC campaigns is science itself, you have to research, experiment, and set new campaigns based on the data gathered from previous campaigns to create optimized PPC ads for your business.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the free tools you can use to nail your PPC ads is Google Alerts. In this article, I’m going to show you how!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What is Google Alerts?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, it’s a notification tool that lets you track when people use certain keywords or keyphrases online. This knowledge ultimately helps you to optimize the existing campaigns and fill in the gaps.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me demonstrate its use with the help of an example.</span>

<strong><i>Say you’re selling chocolates online. You run separate PPC campaigns for each of the chocolates in your stock, such as Mars, Snickers, Cadbury, etc. You can set alerts for certain events, for example whenever someone mentions your company’s name, or the chocolates you’re selling, or post similar content, etc. you get a notification.</i></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that Google only sends you alerts whenever new content is published; you get no notifications about the content that’s already published. And it’s reported that Google doesn’t send you every page that is indexed on Google.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To use Google Alerts, you must be aware of the operators used to set alerts for specific queries. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>How to Set Up Google Alerts?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up Google Alerts barely takes a minute or two. However, in your very first attempt, it might take a bit of time and thinking to set up your first alert.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the step-by-step process:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to google.com/alerts and sign up, or sign in if you already have a Google account.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure it’s the same account where you want to receive alerts.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will see a top bar with a search option, enter the query or phrase for which you want to be notified.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have entered the query, you will see several options below it regarding the region, language, frequency of query, sources, and the place where you want to be notified about it.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the frequency of alerts is concerned, you can receive an alert instantly when the research is made, or once in a week or month.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By choosing a particular company, you can limit the alerts &#8212; that means you will only get an alert when a certain phrase is searched in your target region.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve never used Google Alerts before, I suggest you check out a couple of video demonstrations on YouTube.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>How does it Help in PPC?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, so now you know what Google Alerts are and how you can set up alerts yourself. It’s time to walk you through how this tool can amplify your PPC efforts and bring the best results.</span><b></b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Use Google Alerts to Find Trending Topics</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re not sure which keywords and topics should you target in your campaigns, Google Alert brings a myriad of ideas. In fact, you can begin your content ideas research from here by setting up alerts against keywords relevant to your industry.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every new alert will give you potential phrases and words to use in your next PPC ad copy. You will also discover the strengths of your competitors, the vacuum in your industry, and ultimately improve the results of your ads.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><b>Spy on Your Competitors</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Manual competitor research demands an abundance of time and focus. You can’t find the loopholes in your competitor’s ad if you don’t analyze every element from ad copy to the visuals used. Besides that, every day you have to Google relevant queries to see the results.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Alerts makes this quite straightforward. Just set up an alert with your competitor’s website mentioned in the alert against certain keywords and get alerts whenever a change is made to their ad.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><b>Dig Valuable Data &amp; Use it to Improve</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running successful PPC campaigns is all about experimenting and tracking what’s working and what isn’t. If you’re not getting results, this could be due to a weak ad copy, targeting the wrong audience, or showing your ads at the wrong time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Alerts bring insights regarding your audience. And this data helps you to evaluate your performance and see if months of PPC expenditures have done any good to your online reputation. Do people know you in your industry or not?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can receive alerts if someone types your brand’s name or your product on Google. This way, you will get plenty of information related to demographics, the type of audience mentioning you or search you on Google, and the frequency of those mentions.</span>
