										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Career change is never easy especially if you are someone who has completed Majors in a particular field. But once a person decides to take charge and work towards a new perspective field, there is no looking back. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the story of Digiperformer </span><b>Arpitha</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h2><b>What originally attracted you to choose digital marketing as your career?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a lecturer, I did not see my career going high up at a fast pace. Hence, for a better career opportunity, I decided to switch. Digital marketing provides a fast-paced working environment and that’s what I was looking for.</span>
<h2><b>What exactly makes us stand out from the competition &amp; urge you to choose us over others?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was researching institutes to learn Digital marketing, I found out that Digiperform had the best reviews among all the other institutes. Along with that its placements were very talked about. So, I decided to opt for it.</span>
<h2><b>Would you consider Digiperform as a trusted &amp; reliable resource for Digital marketing training? Why?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I would surely consider Digiperform as a trusted and reliable resource because of its way of training, training content, amazing faculty, and placement opportunities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> I would give it 8.</span>
<h2><b>Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?</b></h2>

<h2><b>If you had a piece of advice to someone just starting out, what would it be?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it is very important to use learning in a practical set up. So even if the experience is unpaid, it is good to start with.</span>
