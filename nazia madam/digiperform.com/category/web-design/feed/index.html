			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been said that space is the final frontier. But there are many who would argue that it’s cyberspace that offers even greater, perhaps infinite potential. And the vast number of websites already in existence gives weight to this thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been estimated that over 250,000 new websites are created every day. And with this in mind, it’s no wonder that it’s become a difficult task to drive traffic to any particular address on the web. But with the proper tools and techniques, you can get an edge on your competition and begin driving traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in business today, you probably understand that it’s greater brand awareness and exposure that gets you more traffic and higher revenue. But how do you go about doing this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a website is one thing. But driving traffic to your website is another. And if you want to shine a beacon from your little corner of cyberspace, the following will offer a few solutions to help you reach this goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Link Building</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want other visitors to find your site easier and organically, this means that you need to rank higher on a search engine results page (SERP). Higher search rankings are what all websites need in order to be considered relevant. And consumers look for relevancy just as much as they look for quality products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building backlinks otherwise referred to as inbound links, refers to the process of another website linking to yours. And when you’re able to link to sites with an established authority and healthy search engine rank, this builds credibility for your site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But link building isn’t a simple process. And this is why most business owners choose to partner with a </span><a href="https://stellarseo.com/services/link-building-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">link building service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that they know their links are being built properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few benefits of link building include the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased site credibility </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More lead generation </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain higher quality traffic </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain referral traffic </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build brand awareness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank higher in Google search</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more quality links you have and the greater quantity of authority links you earn will boost your web presence and prove to be an integral part of your overall marketing strategy. Because with more exposure via link building, you’ll soon see greater revenue. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Email Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many who claim that </span><a href="https://digiperform.com/7-writing-tools-to-build-a-successful-email-marketing-campaign/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a complete waste of time. However, if you’re looking for a marketing investment with the highest ROI and the ability to drive traffic, email marketing shouldn’t be overlooked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing requires research and tools that enable you to reach as many targeted customers as possible. With tools such as timed emails, form-fill tracking, and apps that make emails engaging and comprehensible, you’ll have an ideal toolkit for beginning an email marketing campaign. But how does email marketing help drive traffic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using the following methods, you can drive traffic through email marketing: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage subscriptions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer promotions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use responsive (mobile-friendly) emails </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize video</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporate infographics </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize your landing pages </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send personal emails </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cold-emailing may be a dead-end for some businesses, email marketing is still a key player for generating traffic and revenue. And the bottom line is that with more people added to your email list, the more potential visits to your website you’ll see. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Social Media</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to <a href="https://www.guestblogging.pro/how-to-increase-website-traffic-organically/">boost traffic</a> to your site, running promotions on </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/12/19/end-decade-heres-how-social-media-has-evolved-over-10-years/4227619002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great tactic to employ. And you can easily budget the number of social promotions you have each month without emptying your bank account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you run a business selling art or if you have an online craft store, you can promote individual posts on sites such as Facebook and Instagram. And these posts will contain links to your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During your promotion, you can analyze real-time data regarding how many impressions you’ve made as well as how many visitors your promotion brought to your website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media marketing should also be incorporated with other strategies that gain you a larger following as well. And this is simply because your followers might be closely related to your target customer group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, taking the time to work on your social media marketing can dramatically increase traffic to your site if you take advantage of the many tools these platforms offer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving traffic is part of owning a website. After all, if you owned a physical store that received no traffic, you’d likely not be in business for long. And this is exactly how a website works. So if you build a big enough road, you’ll find that the traffic will increase over time. </span></i></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is so attractive about a retail store you visit to purchase some outfits for you? There is no room for doubt when the physical appearance of the store you wish to spend time shopping, is the best. Appearance and visual satisfaction is an attribute that can directly influence your buying decision. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several other award-winning websites like ESPN that have brought the sports content to the zenith with eye-catching and heart-throbbing website design, and a background video to keep the energy of the sports alive using various transition effects. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Web Design &amp; Development Vs. Digital Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Design &amp; Development refers to an umbrella term that encompasses the processes required to create the final outlook of a website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name sounds, it consists of two main stages: Web design and Web Development. The process of Web design deals with the appearance and visual appeal of a website, whereas web development can define how the website functions. determines how it functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is a broader term that deals with the promotion of goods and services of a business with the use of electronic media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a website is an integral part of a business to focus on digital marketing. Since the buying decisions are directly dependent on the marketing efforts, there should be keen knowledge on how users respond to your website, once the traffic is driven to the website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A renowned web design company or a designer expert can guide your business to make the website design more mind-blowing. Now, still, have doubts on how website design &amp; development can be a real savior to your digital marketing efforts? Let’s deep dive into these explanations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Core Components of Effective Web Design &amp; Development</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the saying goes, the first impression is the best, a website is a point that creates the first impression in the minds of customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It lets you make a safe and secure step towards effective customer communication through a user-friendly and professional website design and careful website development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great website has core elements to be taken care of such as navigation structure, color scheme, </span><a href="https://avivdigital.in/page-speed-seo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimization for speed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, layout, search engine optimization (SEO), conversion rate optimization (CRO), content, graphics, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many businesses don&#8217;t consider the fact that the website design and development is a segment of a <a href="https://www.agorapulse.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-tools/">digital marketing plan</a>, or that they should have the best look, purpose, and feel just like other advertising methods involved in digital marketing just like PPC (pay-per-click) advertising.</span></p>
<h3>Web Design elements contributing to Digital Marketing Strategy</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the factors of website design that contribute to your digital marketing plan to let you achieve your business goals successfully. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is a major factor behind website design concerns. Even though people say that the design elements don&#8217;t impact the rankings of the website, </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/changing-web-layout-can-affect-search-rankings/382700/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has already said that website layout changes can affect the search engine rankings of that particular website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another factor is checking for content duplication. The Search engine algorithm is aligned strongly with the digital marketing plan. Make sure that the content you use for your website is unique and not duplicate content, to maintain search engine friendliness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duplicated content can be caught by Google and this inhibits your page from ranking in the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Along with the design, it is also necessary to incorporate the back-end design with meta tags, meta description, alt tags, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the best SEO-friendly website design of 2019 was grabbed by </span><a href="https://www.spinxdigital.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spinx Digital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the designers and developers have made this highly responsive website with simple, vivid backgrounds, along with excellent typography and quick loading times. Additionally, the informative content and rich graphics have also contributed to the SEO friendliness of the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the best website design, you also invoke great conversion rates. If the website looks neat and feels reliable to the end-user, then it is more likely for the prospect to purchase the product or service from your website or perform a specific action. The Authority and simplicity of a website lead to the ultimate success of a website design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex designs can create confusion among the consumers, hence it is better to avoid making designs complicated to achieve great functionality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex designs can make the website speed too slow, which makes people lose patience and interest in staying on your website, and chances are that you end up losing valuable customers. Let your website be simple for a desirable user experience and complex to a certain extent that satisfies Conversion rates. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost thing that should come to your mind while creating a website, is to have customers or end-users in mind. Ensure that your website is user-friendly, else you fail in gaining enough traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website design affects the user experience for the visitors. Make sure that the website design is easy for navigation and it is easy to click on the website links. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, ensure that the loading speed of your website is high. Consider </span><a href="https://acodez.in/website-optimization-techniques-local-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website optimization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for both computer and mobile devices to ensure that consumers get a seamless experience across these platforms. Avoid large images which can make website loading slow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the best website design of 2019 was that of the </span><a href="https://matruecannabis.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MA True Cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website. The orange theme and youthful vibe of the website give a visual treat to the visitors. It also deploys a combination of 3-D visuals and floating attributes that maintain powerful user engagement and e-commerce experiences to bestow seamless functionality. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Analytics &amp; Reporting Tools</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A website left as it is doesn&#8217;t serve you any better. The journey of a website has many steps, it needs to continuously adapt, optimize, take corrective actions, and evolve as per the changing requirements of users. Now how to find the required changes and consider them to make your site more responsive? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analytics is a simple solution to this problem. Make sure that the website has the best setup and reliable analytics tools are used to collect the data such as user behavior, purchase patterns, bounce rate, conversion rate, and other metrics. You can use tools like Google Analytics to effectively measure and monitor these constraints. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Branding</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website design can easily evoke vibes for the consumers. People figure out the goodness of a website with the way they appear to be at first sight. If a design gives negative feelings to the users then chances are that they avoid your website leaving your brand hopeless.  As users land your website, they build a perception of your brand. Make sure that your brand conveys the correct message to your consumers. Consider logo, font, color, images, and content to keep your website interesting. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Web Design &amp; Development is So Important in Digital Marketing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website represents the products or services you offer to your customers. The more your website becomes interactive and appealing to the consumers, the more engaging your website will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any campaign or promotional event leads users mostly to the website, hence it is vital to keep the website neat and with utmost navigation ease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s make it clear with an interesting concept of  Hick&#8217;s law. It says that if there exist more choices for people to choose, the more time they take to come to a decision. Design experts keep this law while reducing the number of </span><a href="https://acowebs.com/ecommerce-call-to-action/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call-to-actions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or cluttering with too much information.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They always consider making website design crisp and simple that involves merging similar categories into a single menu option. So, visitors find it easy to navigate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be precise, there are many benefits that web design &amp; development serve to the digital marketing strategy. They are:</span></p>
<ol>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build trust and the consistency of your brand</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improves usability of the website for common users</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offers ease of navigation </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website loading speed improves</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bounce rate is reduced to a great extent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversion rates will see an upsurge</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equip you with an edge over the competition</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer satisfaction and customer service are improved</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO strategy is enhanced</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

			<p>Designing a website is more than just worrying about aesthetics and making it look neat and appealing. It needs to achieve a harmonious synthesis of web elements—visuals, indicators, interactions, and text—that work toward a defined goal. For businesses, that would be attracting visitors and helping users understand the company, branding, and products it offers.</p>
<p>So how exactly do you achieve that? By following a holistic web designing process that takes both function and form into account. Here are the critical steps to follow in order to create a web design for your business:</p>
<h4><b>1. Determine Your Goals</b></h4>
<p>During the initial stage, you need to identify the end goal of your website design, typically in close collaboration with stakeholders. You need to explore these questions to define the purpose of your website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the audience?</li>
<li>What do users expect to do or find on the website?</li>
<li>What is the website’s primary purpose: to inform, amuse, or sell?</li>
<li>Does it need to convey your brand’s core message clearly, or is it a part of a broader branding strategy with a unique focus?</li>
<li>Does it have any competitor sites? If so, how should your site be different from or inspired by those competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>If those questions aren’t answered clearly <a href="https://digiperform.com/6-steps-to-write-a-perfect-website-design-brief/">in the brief</a>, the whole project can start in the wrong direction. It can be helpful to write out clearly identified goals or a summary of your expected objectives and aims. This should help put the web design on the right path.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>2. Define The Budget And Timeline</b></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most challenging and common problem seen in web design projects is a murky scope of timeline and budget.</p>
<p>You might set out with an objective or goal in your mind, but this gradually evolves, changes, or expands altogether during the design process. You’ll start with the goal of designing a website, but then you’ll end up wanting to build push notifications, create a web app, do email marketing, and more.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an issue for web designers, increased expectations are often unmatched by an increase in timeline or budget, making the project unrealistic.</p>
<p>A Gantt chart can be employed to manage and prevent going over the expected timeline and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/costs-building-websites-2019/">cost of web design</a>. It helps detail an achievable timeline and cost for the project, including any significant landmarks to set boundaries and realistic deadlines.</p>
<p>It provides an invaluable reference for clients and designers alike, helping keep everyone focused on the goals and task at hand.</p>
<h3><b>3. Draw A Sitemap And Wireframes</b></h3>
<p>Once you have a clear goal and timeline and a budgeting scope, it’s time to build your sitemaps and wireframes. Think of a sitemap as a blueprint. It helps give you a clear idea of a website’s information architecture and defines the relationships between various elements and pages.</p>
<p>Then, you’ll need to build a mockup of the visual design of a <a href="https://digiperform.com/why-you-need-a-web-design-for-your-website/">website</a> known as a wireframe. It offers a framework for storing content elements and graphic design and helps determine potential gaps and challenges with your sitemap. It shows you where the navigation is, where you’ll place videos or images, where the logo will be, etc.</p>
<p>A wireframe doesn’t contain any final design elements and only acts as a guide for how your website will look. It also serves as an inspiration in formatting various aspects.</p>
<h3><b>4. Fill It With Content</b></h3>
<p>Once you’re done with the framework, it’s time to fill your site with content—from headlines and body copy to product descriptions to brand and team information.</p>
<p>Depending on the goals, it might be worth hiring an SEO or content <a href="https://connectivewebdesign.com/services/marketing">marketing agency</a> to assist with your content in order to drive action and engagement or boost your website’s visibility for search engines.</p>
<h3><b>5. Create The Visual Elements</b></h3>
<p>By now, your website should look plain and dull with unappealing blocks of text. It’s time to make it livelier by adding the visuals. This part of the <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-rewards-of-using-instagram-for-your-web-design-business/">web design</a> process will often be shaped by existing brand elements, logos and color, and font choices.</p>
<p>Visual elements are taking a more significant role in the success of web design. Not only can it make your website look more professional, but it can also communicate your brand’s messaging and build trust.</p>
<p>Consider working with a professional photographer to capture the right images for your website. While you can try using free stock photos, those will make your website look generic. You also need to choose a color and font scheme, ensuring uniformity throughout your site and establishing brand identity.</p>
<p>Visual design is a way to appeal and communicate to your site’s users. Done right, it’ll contribute to the success of your website. Done wrong, the site will just become another web address.</p>
<h3><b>6. Test It And Go Live</b></h3>
<p>Once your website finally looks like a website, it’s time to test it. Testing ensures that your website loads correctly on all browsers and devices, the links are working, and the visuals look as good as they should. Testing allows you to find minor coding errors and mistakes so you can fix them before going public.</p>
<p>Once the test passes in flying colors, it’s time to launch! Even if you do rigorous testing, don’t expect your launch to go perfectly. There’ll still be some elements that’d require fixing, and that’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Remember: web design is a continually developing process that requires constant maintenance. Once your website goes live, you have to keep testing new visuals, features, and content, refining your brand’s messaging, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/12/03/11-game-changing-reasons-to-monitor-your-website-traffic/">monitoring analytics</a>. In doing so, you can keep it up to date and tweak it from time to time to meet your target audience’s needs and preferences.</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>And there you have it—you’ve just learned how to design a functioning website in six simple steps. Hopefully, this article has helped you go from a blank idea to a thought-through website that quickly gets off the ground.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind, though, that you’re never 100% done with your site’s design or development. There’s always room for improvement, which would allow your website to continue thriving in the competitive digital world.</p>

			<p>Going online has not only become a trend, but also a lifestyle. Websites and personal blogs abound as more entrepreneurs also establish their platforms and niches online.</p>
<p>It has become a must for all companies and businesses alike to set an online presence through websites and blogs as major forms of digital marketing.</p>
<p>Generally, people interchangeably use blogs and websites. It must be noted that websites differ from blogs in various aspects.</p>
<p>Before delving into the differences between a website and a blog, you need to understand how each of them works first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Are Websites?</h3>
<p>When you open a browser, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, and enter any web address like www.website.com, you’ll end up on a website. In fact, YouTube, Facebook, And Google are also called websites. Thus, the pages you navigate from a web browser are considered websites.</p>
<p>Websites require an allocated space for file storage, including images and codes. This is called web hosting.</p>
<p>There are services that outline and offer affordable <a href="https://www.hostens.com/shared-hosting/">shared web hosting plans</a> to assist you in launching your website without hassle.</p>
<p>There are many types of websites you can create, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>E-Commerce Website</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An e-commerce website serves as an online store where you can sell your services or products. It’s the perfect forum to advertise and promote your <a href="https://digiperform.com/a-beginner-guide-to-start-an-ecommerce-business-in-2021/">e-commerce business</a>. Through this, earning income and gaining more customers will just be a click away.</p>
<p>Customers can purchase products directly through your website. Your website can also be a guide to show your clients the location of your physical store. In short, an e-commerce website is the extension of your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Business Website</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from directly selling your products with an e-commerce website, you can also have a business website. This site doesn’t necessarily mean you’re selling your products.</p>
<p>A business site is a site that represents your business. It communicates your vision and mission, products and services, and some technicalities such as your business mantra and logo.</p>
<p>Your site helps build your credibility since nowadays, people automatically assume you have a website if you own a business. Hence, they can verify your credibility and learn more about your company. It also serves as proof that your business is legitimate and reputable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Service providers also need a website to showcase the services they offer. A portfolio website is where they post examples of their past work. This is easier to build than a business or e-commerce website because the focus is merely on enumerating and collecting work samples. This way, they can show their skills and encourage businesses or individuals to hire them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Are Blogs?</h3>
<p>A blog is a type of website containing blog posts or articles from an individual or a team of writers. The latest content appears on the first pages of the website.</p>
<p>Historically, blogs evolved from online journals and diaries in the mid-90s. These web pages were updated discussing the writers’ social commentaries, thoughts, and personal lives. Previously, these pages were called ‘weblog.’</p>
<p>From ‘weblog’ to ‘we blog,’ a webpage is now known as a ‘blog.’</p>
<p>Since blogging became popular, blogging tools and platforms have risen. For instance, one can easily set up a blog using WordPress and other popular blogging platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Earning Money Through Blogs</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a business but want to earn money online, you can set up a blog. Many bloggers are earning even without owning a business. Here are some ways how to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Books And eBooks<b>:</b></h4>
<p>Some bloggers have gone from blogging to publishing their books. They do this by showcasing their writing skills in their blogs. If you create high-quality and valuable content, you may also attract publishers and book deals.</li>
<li>
<h4>Affiliate Marketing:</h4>
<p>Writing blogs can also help you earn passive income, such as in the case of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/01/23/affiliate-marketing-in-2020-what-it-is-and-how-beginners-can-get-started/?sh=7cb2859e61c2">affiliate marketing</a>. This type of service allows you to write blogs while recommending physical products, digital products, or other services offered by various companies. When readers click on the link of these products or services, you’ll get a commission. You can achieve this by creating valuable content.</li>
<li>
<h4>Selling Freelance Services:</h4>
<p>Not only can you use your blogs to earn passive income, but you can also use them as a way to get clients. This means you can make money writing for people as a freelancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blogs Vs Websites</h3>
<p>As mentioned, a blog is a type of website. What makes it unique from other types of websites is its regularly updated content. As for websites, they’re more static and posts updates only when necessary.</p>
<p>Also, a website can have a blog section. Since websites are organized into pages, one page may contain blogs. This is true for most business or portfolio websites. Thus, a blog can be a part of a bigger website, or it can also be a website on its own.</p>
<p>Due to the potential of blogging, more companies or businesses now use blogs as part of their search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing strategies. Businesses use blogs to keep their customers updated with their products and events. Some also use blogs to engage with their customers.</p>
<p>Therefore, a website can consist of blogs, especially for the case of business websites. They have ‘about us’ pages, which are static, and blog pages that they regularly update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Differences In Content</h3>
<p>As mentioned, websites have pages, and these are similar to a brochure’s sections or pages. These pages divide the different categories of the website.</p>
<p>For instance, one page can contain the business’ general information, while the other page is a home page. Other pages may contain descriptions of the services or products.</p>
<p>For blogs or posts, the content may encompass various topics. Depending on the blogger or writer’s niche, each article talks about anything related to the said niche.</p>
<p>To make blogs more interesting, bloggers incorporate a combination of social media feeds, podcasts, videos, or infographics into their blogs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Now that you know what makes blogs and websites different, you can now decide how to create an online presence for your business. Depending on your business, you may want to start with a blog or a website with blogs. No matter what industry you’re in, you need to establish your platform online. It is undeniable that websites and blogs will help grow your business and gain more customers.</p>

			<p>When it comes to websites, one of the most important choices you can make is regarding a web hosting plan. In fact, a web hosting plan is the backbone of your website, no matter what business you have.</p>
<p>Not only does it affect your website’s performance, but it also impacts your business’s success. And because there are so many web hosting options out there, picking the right one might seem overwhelming at first.</p>
<p>However, the key to selecting the right web hosting plan is understanding your website and business requirements. For instance, picking a cheaper hosting plan can slow down your website, depending on the amount of traffic it gets. And since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064551/https://digiperform.com/the-importance-of-an-online-presence-for-every-business/">every business must have an online presence</a> nowadays, you have to make sure that the web hosting plan fits your needs perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Web Hosting Types</h3>
<p>First of all, before you make a choice, you will need to understand the basic types of web hosting. And while they might seem quite similar at first, each has its pros and cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shared Hosting</h3>
<p>Shared hosting is a service where a number of websites reside on one web server connected to the internet. That works by splitting the server into thousands of smaller accounts, each sharing the server’s bandwidth and storage.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, shared hosting is the budget option, as the entry cost is much lower compared to other types of hosting. But as a result, there are some security concerns, such as DDoS attacks, which make the sharing of server resources a potential risk factor. You should consider shared hosting for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites</li>
<li>Startup or local businesses</li>
<li>Low traffic websites</li>
<li>Smaller budgets</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VPS Hosting</h3>
<p>VPS hosting uses virtualization to replicate a dedicated environment within a shared server. It works by creating multiple virtual instances, each with its own resources and limitations. But overall, all VPS instances are granted a portion of the parent server’s hardware, similar to shared hosting.</p>
<p>However, compared to shared hosting, VPS offers better performance and more freedom. It also allows for deeper customization and control over your server and website. As a result, VPS hosting is perfect for:</p>
<ul>
<li>High traffic websites</li>
<li>E-commerce websites</li>
<li>Medium to big-budget businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dedicated Hosting</h3>
<p>Dedicated hosting permits you to rent an entire server, giving you access to all its resources. And since dedicated servers are isolated from one another, users get full access to configure their server any way they want. As such, dedicated hosting provides the highest level of resource allocation, privacy, and control.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that dedicated servers are more suited for big corporations that require high uptimes and good speeds. That’s because dedicated servers are much more costly than any other similar hosting plan. But overall, dedicated hosting works best for:</p>
<ul>
<li>High budget businesses</li>
<li>E-commerce websites</li>
<li>High traffic websites</li>
<li>Group of websites</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How Can I Choose the Right Web Hosting Plan?</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, choosing the right web hosting plan boils down to knowledge. Because of that, we recommend you ask yourself the following questions before proceeding with any web hosting out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. How Much Am I Willing To Invest In Web Hosting?</h4>
<p>The first thing you must do is to determine a budget for web hosting. If you’re on a limited and strict budget, you can go for a cheaper option such as shared hosting. But if you can invest more, then you should consider VPS or even dedicated hosting.</p>
<p>However, while the upfront cost can seem affordable at first, you will need to think about renewal prices too. For example, a hosting company may allow you to sign up for as little as $5 but then ask for ten times that amount when renewing their service. And since switching web hosts can be hard, you will have no choice but to cave in to their demands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. How Much Traffic Am I Expecting?</h4>
<p>The more web traffic your site receives, the more bandwidth it will require to keep running smoothly. As a result, you need to estimate the number of monthly visitors before you decide on a web hosting service. But predicting the right amount of traffic is hard, if not impossible.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you can choose a high bandwidth plan, paying for more than you could ever use. On the other hand, restricted bandwidth will result in a bad user experience if your website gets too popular. The best solution is to choose a web hosting plan that can scale on demand.</p>
<p>Our advice is to go for a VPS plan since it’s only a bit more expensive than shared hosting. Also, it offers more bandwidth and the option of increasing it depending on the growth of your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. What Type Of Content Do I Plan To Use?</h4>
<p>Any server has a limited number of resources, including bandwidth and, more importantly, space. As such, you should think about what type of content you plan to upload on the server. For instance, video content requires much more space and bandwidth than image or text content.</p>
<p>Additionally, some web hosting providers can up the costs once you go over a threshold. In fact, hosting providers that supposedly offer <i>unlimited </i>space will either make you pay more or close your website altogether once you use too many resources. That’s because you are actually sharing the disk space with other users, meaning that the more space you need, the less the others will have.</p>
<p>As a result, you should always read the terms of service before you try any type of hosting, especially unlimited ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Where Are The Web Hosting Servers Located?</h4>
<p>Nowadays, privacy is not only an option, it’s a must — especially if your website handles sensitive information. And when it comes to data privacy and security, server location is extremely important.</p>
<p>Not only do you want your server to be in a secure location, but you want it to provide additional layers of defense in case of cyberattacks. And while most hosting servers should be secure, some offer better protection and security features.</p>
<p>Additionally, some countries block access to specific types of content. In other words, if the server is located in a country where your content is forbidden, the website will be taken down. As a result, you will want to carefully choose the location of your server depending on what type of content you want to upload.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid all that trouble, your best bet is to go for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064551/https://abelohost.com/offshore-web-hosting/">offshore hosting</a>. That’s because it offers total data privacy, anonymity, and most importantly, a flexible content policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. What Are The Server Uptime Records?</h4>
<p>It doesn’t really matter what kind of website you own — uptime is important. Needless to say, you want a reliable host that can guarantee almost 100% uptime. However, some hosts define uptime differently, so you should look up the company’s policy before signing up.</p>
<p>And since downtime is almost inevitable, you must know how the hosting provider handles it. You need to understand that downtime is as much a technical issue as a PR issue. How a company responds to a downtime crisis says a lot about its commitment to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Our advice is to look for reviews that indicate the reliability and history of the web hosting service. For instance, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064551/https://uncensoredhosting.com/best-european-hosting/">European hosting providers</a> are well-known for their high uptime. That is due to modern infrastructure and cutting-edge technology, which often surpasses that of the US.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>6. Which Level Of Customization Do I Need?</h4>
<p>Depending on what kind of website you want, customization is a key factor in deciding on a web hosting plan. If you plan to use custom apps or specialized software, you will need a comprehensive plan that gives you complete control. And as we previously brushed on, each type of hosting solution allows for different levels of customization.</p>
<p>Shared hosting is restrictive since any change is applied to all the websites operating on that server. However, VPS hosting allows users to customize their environment without disrupting others. And if you want full customization, you should always go for dedicated hosting, since it provides you with full control over the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. Will I Be Collecting Sensitive Information?</h4>
<p>If you are handling customer data, encryption and backups should be your highest priority. And while every hosting company provides a certain level of security, some are better at withstanding cyber-attacks than others.</p>
<p>Shared hosting comes short when talking about security since multiple websites share a single server. So one flaw can cripple all websites hosted on that particular server, leaving you vulnerable to potential attacks. That can be devastating if you are saving customer information such as passwords or credit card details.</p>
<p>On the opposite spectrum, dedicated servers offer the highest level of security. As a result, all of the resources go into protecting your website and your customer’s data. That’s exactly why most e-commerce websites go for dedicated servers instead of other cheaper options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>All in all, choosing the perfect web hosting plan depends entirely on your goal and budget. However, it’s important to understand that the success of your website is tied to your web host. As an example, web hosting can affect the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218064551/https://digiperform.com/4-ways-a-web-hosting-can-impact-your-seo-rankings/">SEO ranking</a> of your website, reducing or increasing its popularity. Besides that, web hosting reliability can mean the difference between a simple visitor and a new customer.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend that you pay close attention to all the features we previously discussed when picking a host. You should also research different companies and hosting plans before committing to any of them. But you won’t have anything to worry about as long as you follow our tips and pay attention to online reviews and feedback.</p>

			<p>The process of developing a website is complex and oftentimes very demanding. There are developers and designers working together to make sure they reach final results according to the needs and ideas of their clients. However, there can be a lot of confusion and some misunderstandings, unless there’s a killer web design brief.</p>
<p>A web design brief is created with the aim to communicate the needs of the client to the development team and make sure everyone’s on the same page. It needs to be detailed, goal-oriented, and communicate the right message to everyone involved. This is why we’ve put together a guide with 6 essential steps for writing a winning web design brief.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Your Business Overview<b><br />
</b></h3>
<p>Your web developers need to be familiar with the type of business you’re running, to better understand your needs. This is why every web design brief should start with a business overview.</p>
<p>Here’s what you should clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of business you have</li>
<li>the industry you’re in</li>
<li>what sort of website do you need</li>
<li>who are your biggest competitors</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an existing business that already has a website, you need to write about that as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>your current website situation</li>
<li>how your customers find and use it</li>
</ul>
<p>Cover as many details as possible to give the developing team a detailed image of what your current business situation is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Describe Your Customers &amp; Target Audience</h3>
<p>When the developers start working on your new website, your target audience becomes their target audience.</p>
<p>They need to be thinking about the people who will be using the website and design it with those people in mind. Therefore, describe your target audience in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>sex</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>online behavior</li>
<li>habits</li>
<li>preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>Give a detailed report about your customers and make sure you provide all the information you’ve got on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Goals of the Project</h3>
<p>Now it’s time to set the goals that you’d like the developing team to achieve with the project. That means you should explain what you want your new website to bring you.</p>
<p>There can be all types of goals, especially depending on whether you’re creating a brand new website or fixing the old one. Here’s what we have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve website performance</li>
<li>add an e-commerce section</li>
<li>create a new website to help potential customers find you and get informed</li>
<li>generate more leads</li>
<li>improve traffic</li>
<li>improve your online presence</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you know what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210102184333/https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/02/20/13-website-design-principles-any-business-should-keep-in-mind/?sh=405bb056dc8a">web design principles</a> you want to follow, and state them clearly in your web design brief to make sure there’s no room for confusion or misunderstandings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Specific Features &amp; Requirements</h3>
<p>Once you’ve set the ground with some basic information, it’s time to dig a little deeper and get into more details in your web design brief.</p>
<p>If you have any specific technical requirements you’d like your new website to have, make sure to write it down.</p>
<p>Here’s what you may want to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>user logins, registration, and authorization</li>
<li>products and services you’re selling and offering</li>
<li>product categories</li>
<li>payment &amp; checkout methods</li>
<li>site blog</li>
<li>About us page</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210102184333/https://www.editingcorp.com/optimize-your-workflow-with-portfolio-website/">portfolio</a> page</li>
<li>user profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>You can even describe each section, and make a list of features you want to see on the screen. You’ll be helping the developing team understand your vision and try to find the best solution to make it happen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Project Timeline &amp; Deadline</h3>
<p>You want to be sure that the team you hire to create your new website will be working round the clock to make it as efficient and professional as possible. This is why you have to set some deadlines and agree on the project timeline for everyone to follow.</p>
<p>You could divide the project into several phases and set a deadline for each of the phases. Those include:</p>
<ul>
<li>agreeing on the project goals and starting the project</li>
<li>sitemap creation</li>
<li>creating the content</li>
<li>adding the visual elements</li>
<li>testing the website</li>
<li>launching the website</li>
</ul>
<p>Set a deadline for each of the phases to make sure you’re keeping track of everything that the developers are doing with your website. This way you’ll be sure they’ll meet the final deadline and achieve all the goals you’ve set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>Another important aspect you’ll need to cover in your web design brief is the budget. You have to set a budget for the project and make it clear how much you’re willing to spend.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that the budget will influence the end result, so make sure you leave some room for negotiating.</p>
<p>Other than that, make sure to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>the total sum you’ll be paying</li>
<li>the payment dynamics</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, you’ll be showing you’re professionalism and respect for the team you’re hiring. Once they agree on the price and accept your offer, they’ll be ready to start working on your new website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Writing a killer web design brief is a necessity for anyone looking to hire a team of professional web developers. The brief will give you the power to set goals, express your wishes, and tell them exactly what you want.</p>
<p>Use the steps we’ve covered above to write a brilliant web design brief and get the website you want for your business.</p>
