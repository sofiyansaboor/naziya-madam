<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 1: How Does The Ministry of Food Processing (Govt. Of India) spread awareness about World Food India through social media platforms?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries which is a ministry of the Government of India was looking for various ways to promote and spread awareness about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbMqyuwYelJ2ZJaj340StQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbMqyuwYelJ2ZJaj340StQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food India</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ministry wanted to promote India as the world’s food factory. They desperately needed a way out where they could interact and raise not only awareness about the same but to educate Indians on how India is the largest producer of food and food products, suffers from an acute shortage of food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, yet 40% of its food production is wasted annually. Therefore, the country especially the youth needed an awakening regarding the same and World Food Day was the ideal time to start it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meantime, The Ministry analyzed that youth is highly approachable on social media platforms, and therefore, they need to look out for innovative digital marketing case studies to reach them directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the same, they hired a <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-100-digital-marketing-agencies-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing agency</a> that designed a creative marketing strategy that talked about food wastage and how to tackle it. The agency targeted the audience with creative posts and engaging campaigns with hashtags.     </span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 4: How KFC India Boosted its Social Media Presence with campaigns like ‘Design your own bucket’, ‘Radio KFC RJ Hunt, and ‘Currycature’</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is the best platform when it comes to boosting your online presence and increasing the sale of products within the country. The same has been well followed by KFC which is a famous global restaurant chain brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s the number one restaurant brand on social media in India. KFC tried many campaigns to increase its <a href="https://digiperform.com/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-increase-your-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online presence on social media platforms</a> for brand awareness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KFC had launched very famous campaigns like </span><b><i>Radio KFC RK Hunt</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b><i>Design Your Own Bucket campaign,</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b><i>Currycature</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to target the youth audience by involving mobile apps. These campaigns helped them to develop their brand awareness as well as increased engagement.</span></p>
<p><b>How?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they started </span><b><i>Radio KFC RJ Hunt</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Campaign, 3000 people from around 30 Indian cities participated in the competition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39059 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc1.png" alt="RJ Audition" width="477" height="519" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc1.png 580w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc1-276x300.png 276w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a social media campaign to promote KFC’s brand in-house radio channel where fans recorded their voices over the internet with the Facebook App and shared their analog radio experience. Especially newcomers wanted to try their hands over this hunt and decided to take part to collaborate with the famous brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/kfc-india-launches-its-first-ever-digital-only-campaign-211783491.html">“</a></span><b><i>Design Your Own Bucket</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” campaign was another social media marketing strategy where the participants were asked to create their own creative KFC buckets. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 5500 entries took place in total where the participants came up with their colorful KFC buckets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, they have also introduced bucket entries with Sachin&#8217;s picture on the KFC bucket on the day when he retired. Amazing right!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39060 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest.jpeg" alt="KFC contest" width="408" height="400" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest.jpeg 520w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest-300x294.jpeg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kfc-contest-75x75.jpeg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>

Around 17K Currycatures were made by their fans which gave them a unique experience with the brand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 5: Tata Sky’s Campaign &#8211; Transferkar Family</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tata Sky is known as a well-known brand with many digital marketing case studies and you can judge by the name, the <a href="https://www.campaignindia.in/video/tata-sky-builds-excitement-for-new-offering-with-the-transferkars/423422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign was solely targeted on families</a>. Obviously, the motto of the campaign was to promote Tata Sky’s product/services called Tata Sky+ Transfer. This new product is used to transfer the recorded content from TV to mobile or tablets.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TATA SKY - Meet Kajal from the Transferkar Family" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEI8nQD0zRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, in each family, everyone has their own preferences when it comes to channels. In families but due to some reason, not everyone watches their favorite shows at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is very common in Indian families where most of the time TV remote is controlled by the head of the family and others just follow his/her favorites. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this purpose, the brand came up with an idea and created the out-of-mind family named </span><b><i>Transferkars</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This product helped family members to transfer their favorite shows on mobiles or tablets and enjoy every bit of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign was a huge success and got viral through social media and TV commercials. Various kind of family-related content was shared during the campaign with discounted offers to the clients. Basically, their understanding of the potential market made the campaign a huge hit.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 6: Paper Boat’s #FloatABoat campaign on social media</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paper Boat is a very known Indian brand of traditional beverages known for drinks which you can commonly prepare at home like aam Panna, Gol Gappa ka Pani, Jamun Kala khatta, and kokum. These kinds of flavors are quite common among Indian families but not everyone can prepare them at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Paper Boat&#8217;s mission states, the purpose of these drinks was to take you back in those memories and float a boot this monsoon. And, the same purpose is very well carried by the team through digital marketing campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They created numerous innovative campaigns that targeted the emotional side of the audience and made them in love with the brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However one of Paper Boat’s campaigns was a huge hit among audiences called </span><a href="https://bestmediainfo.com/2015/07/paper-boat-revives-childhood-memories-with-floataboat-campaign/"><b><i>#FloatABoat</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-39063 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-12.24.jpg" alt="Float A Boat" width="623" height="354" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-12.24.jpg 623w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-12.24-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can get the idea by the name, the company asked people to make a paper boat like they used to make in their childhood days and share it on social media by using the hashtag along with the title of the campaign i.e. </span><a href="https://www.paperboatdrinks.com/hopefloats"><b>#FloatABoat</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and following their social media pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another purpose reviled by the brand is that if someone shared this on any social media, Paper Boat will donate Rs.20 for children’s education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose behind the campaign touched millions of hearts and it was a big success that caused timelines to be jammed with paper boats. You can analyze now how many followers Paper Boat got during the campaign. </span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 7: Nivea India’s ‘Mom’s Touch</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This campaign was dedicated to all the extraordinary and selfless mothers designed especially on Mother’s Day. <a href="https://campaignsoftheworld.com/tv/nivea-moms-touch-the-power-of-care/">Nivea’s Mom’s Touch campaign</a> talked about some extraordinary, selfless stories of the mother from all over the country.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NIVEA Mom’s Touch- Stories of Extraordinary Mothers and Extraordinary Care" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0iSn2alwc8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand asked the audience to share the selfless moment of their mothers by sharing this video over social media platforms. Their marketing strategy also had a beautiful objective to gain viewership. The brand made a promise that by sharing this video on social media the donation from the brand was done for the girls.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Case Study 8: KKR &#8211; IPL Team’s Digital Marketing Strategy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not even the IPL team could stay far away from the digital world. Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) is the franchise representing Kolkata in the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 cricket tournament whose co-owner is one of the famous film stars &#8211;  Shahrukh Khan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Sneak Peak:</strong></span></h3>
<strong>Read this case study to know how a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider used LinkedIn Sponsored Content to generate 38% more leads at 65% lower cost.</strong>
<strong>Company:</strong> Kinvey
<strong>Industry:</strong>  Service
<strong>Tool Used:</strong> LinkedIn Sponsored Content
<strong>Result:</strong> ­ 38% more leads @ 65% lower cost
<strong>Business Type:</strong> B2B
<h3><strong>The Brand &amp; the Story</strong></h3>
A Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider, Kinvey intends to make the building of enterprise-grade mobile apps more efficient. The brand generally makes use of content for attracting and nurturing high-quality leads across different markets. The main challenge before the brand was to generate leads from two niche audiences that would not respond to the same types of content. However, for achieving its goals, Kinvey turned to LinkedIn Sponsored Content that helped the brand reach their specific audiences with the help of engaging content to generate quality leads.
<h3><strong>Kinvey’s objective behind using LinkedIn Sponsored Content</strong></h3>
Kinvey was hunting for a new source of high-quality leads that could fill its <a href="https://zopto.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/">sales funnel</a> however the two key audiences it had, mobile-focused enterprise IT specialists and businesses that would quickly deploy mobile apps, were not easy to be found. On top of it, both the niche audiences had different taste for content and most likely would not have responded to same types of content. So, the brand needed to target their eBooks, guides, and presentations in such a way that the right prospects see the right content.
<h3><strong>Kinvey’s strategy for using LinkedIn Sponsored Content</strong></h3>
Kinvey made effective use of LinkedIn Sponsored Content that is celebrated for offering unique targeting capabilities and could easily reach its niche audiences with the right messages. Moreover, the brand could also drive qualified traffic into its lead nurture program by maximizing the reach of its eBooks and other materials as Sponsored Content appears in LinkedIn feeds across desktop, tablet and smartphone.
“We strive to create content that’s useful to businesses involved in mobile app development, and we want to bring that content directly to the people who will benefit most from it,” says Lauren Pedigo, digital marketing manager at Kinvey. “LinkedIn Sponsored Content is a natural fit for us because members are looking to expand their knowledge base—and because we could provide each of our target audiences with the content that addresses their unique business needs.”
<h3><strong>Accelerating the lead generation @ a lower cost</strong></h3>
The powerful LinkedIn targeting capabilities along with delivering the content directly into LinkedIn members’ feeds helped Kinvey generate 38% more leads at a 65% lower cost per lead in comparison to other social channels.
“We slowly tested and grew our investment each month, and the results speak for themselves,” says Pedigo.
<strong><em>Campaign Highlights:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>38% more leads than other social channels</li>
 	<li>65% lower cost per lead than other social Channels</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to generate leads using LinkedIn Sponsored Content: <span style="color: #ff6600;">Suggestions by Lauren Pedigo, Digital Marketing Manager at Kinvey</span></strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#1: Understand your goals!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“Decide what action you value as a conversion,” Pedigo says. “In our case, it’s a content offer sign up. We focus on that specific action and aim to maximize results for our budget. Measurement is imperative: If you don’t collect data on what you’re doing, you’ll never know if it’s working.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#2: Maximize the value of your leads with a nurture program!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“As a B2B company, we know that people don’t become a lead and then buy a product the next day,” she explains. “We educate and nurture our leads so when they’re ready to buy, our brand is top of mind. We use marketing automation software to run nurture email campaigns, score leads, and then forward qualified leads to our sales team. Nurturing gives us the maximum benefit of the leads we acquire through LinkedIn’s Sponsored Content. If we didn’t nurture our leads, we’d miss out on the vast majority of people who are interested in learning about our product and purchasing at a later time.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#3: Match your content to your audience!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“We serve specific content to targeted audiences and organize LinkedIn advertising campaigns around those audiences,” Pedigo says. “Customizing copy and artwork around audiences is a </em><em>high priority. If we’re serving eBook content around mobile strategy best practices, we’ll use different art and copy that resonates with a CMO versus a CTO.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#4: Test multiple targeting facets and creatives!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“We’re running 20 to 50 campaigns weekly and continuously A/B testing different copy and artwork,” Pedigo says. “We make adjustments in real time. For example, we discovered that using cool colors such as green, blue, and purple in ad artwork improved our CTR by 25 percent. We compare CTR diligently because we know that LinkedIn, like every social platform, optimizes for CTR and shows content less often when engagement drops. That’s why we prioritize refreshing art and copy for Sponsored Content every week.”</em></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Suggestion#5: Seek campaign ideas from across your company!</strong></h4>
<blockquote><em>“We get ideas for content from both our sales and engineering teams,” says Pedigo. “The marketing team is perpetually talking with sales about the types of questions they receive from leads. We also talk with engineering about topics that are emerging in the mobile space. In terms of process, we have an outsourced writer interview our developers about a topic we choose and then they place the content of the interview into an eBook. We have an in-house graphic designer that does the creative for all eBooks.”</em></blockquote>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://magnetoitsolutions.com/infographic/mobile-commerce-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobile Commerce Trends</a> has also served as a trigger for new industries and services or helped existing ones grow, including:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile money transfers.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic tickets and boarding pass.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital content purchases and delivery.</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile marketing, coupons, and loyalty cards.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>USPs of M-Commerce:</b>
<b>SEO BENEFITS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; You can also use app indexation tags, letting users download the dedicated app straight from the search results (like Uber has done), or assign the URL schemes within deep app pages, etc.</span>
<b>MOBILE SEARCH EXPERIENCE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; M-commerce pays particular attention to a search box. Convenient on-site search options help users find the desired product easily, avoiding the need to scroll through the pile of irrelevant pages.</span>
<b>TIME-EFFICIENCY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; If customers decide to make a purchase directly through an app, it will take them on average 150% less time as opposed to using the desktop version.</span>
<b>PUSH NOTIFICATIONS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Push notifications are astoundingly more effective than emails. They are instant and difficult to ignore when popping-up on a phone screen. This feature can motivate the customers to be more loyal and provide one more level of engagement.</span>

<b>Role of M-Commerce in E-commerce:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">M-commerce has been gaining popularity with time but still a vast majority of e-commerce owners and retailers are unaware of its tremendous influence. They are still juggling with marketing strategies to create awareness and popularity of their online stores. <a href="https://digiperform.com/top-reasons-ecommerce-can-hugely-boost-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">India’s retail e-commerce sector is small but still growing</a>.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15871 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-12-at-5.39.32-PM-300x170.png" alt="" width="554" height="314" />
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2020, e-commerce sales are expected to total $79.41 billion.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile’s share of e-commerce continues to grow. In 2016, m-commerce sales will total $15.27 billion, making up 65.3% of all e-commerce sales. Those figures will rise to $63.53 billion and 80.0% by the end of the forecast period. Smartphone with the wider adoption of 4G-capable devices and service plans are booming and quite responsible for this growth.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complicated regulations have resulted in the dominance of marketplaces over inventory-model e-commerce sites in India—with Flipkart, Amazon India, Snapdeal and Paytm among the platform leaders. However, the sector is likely on the verge of a wave of consolidation, and Alibaba’s expected entry to the market will have a significant impact.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce in India stands out in terms of how common cash on delivery (COD) is as a payment method. However, mobile wallets and other payment systems have the power to displace COD and have been winning hearts as well with so many cashback offer and feasibility.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Case Study 1: </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are are many companies who even decided to follow </span><b>App-only E-commerce model</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in India, for example, </span><b>Myntra</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bangalore based &#8211; Myntra, India’s leading fashion and lifestyle e-tailer, brought back its mobile website which it had discontinued in May 2015. Nearly 90% of traffic and 70% of the company’s business was happening through its app which led Myntra to take a major step on the solo route of app-only. Myntra claimed to be the first and topmost web-based e-tailer to adopt an app-only model not just in India but globally.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15874 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/myntra-300x176.png" alt="" width="711" height="417" />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Myntra launched a new version of its app that allows users to connect with each other for sharing opinions on products, trends, preferences and so on. Every Myntra app user now sees a different landing page based on previous visits, preferences and other social media plugins like Facebook. Myntra, which has close to 20 million app downloads and 7.6 million active customers, offers over 230,000 products from over 1,700 national and international brands. It also has around 10 in-house brands. The firm currently has an annualized gross merchandise value (GMV &#8211; the total value of sales on the platform) of $500 million. It is looking to cross GMV of $1 billion and also become the first major Indian e-tailer to turn profitable in 2016. By 2020, the target is to cross $5 billion GMV.</span>
<b>App-Advantage:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">App only strategy is quite innovative but gutsy move by Myntra notable given to its scale. Apps, of course, come with a long list of advantages for both the companies and customers such as personalization, better user interface, superior customer experience, ability to easily connect anytime and anywhere, rich customer data and so on.</span>

<b>Case study 2: Paytm</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today Paytm is a market leader in both recharge and mobile wallets. It also provided various other facilities like online booking of movies, bus tickets, online ordering payments, wallet money and many more. In case of recharges, they had several Incumbents Like Overcharge in the market. They concentrated in providing as many recharge options on the site and focused what a user really wants.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15875 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paytm-205x300.png" alt="" width="357" height="522" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a customer lands on website or app, he looks for easiest ways to recharge with offers with proper detail or cash back. Most people follow same recharge amounts over and over again as per their usage, for example, these days youngsters are more into Rs 499 prepaid recharge where they get 1GB of data each day with unlimited outgoing for 3 months. These types of recharges last and beneficial for a long time period. Therefore, the app also gives the remainder of the same whenever the recharges are about to expire- just for better user experience. These quick bites only come handy with mobile devices. They have realized a lot of users requested how to keep the money so that they can do repeated recharges without entering bank account details over and over again. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm do 400,000 orders per day, which is the second highest number of Internet transactions. Their core strength is only &#8211; the mobile. More than 50% of the orders are through their mobile app and mobile site, making them the largest mobile commerce platform.</span>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">India is sitting on a goldmine of online shopping which is quite accessible to many people at attractive prices through the handy platform &#8211; mobile. M-commerce is ready to be explored with its unique characteristics of selling the variety of products giving brand shopping in India a new shape and meaning.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the sizzling personalities who has mesmerized the country through his perfect plans. From Digital India to Skill India, each mission has proved his only motto to help India to be recognized as one of the top developed countries in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of his mainstreaming programs &#8211; </span><b>Digital India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; has aimed at inclusive growth in areas of network connectivity, electronic services, products, manufacturing and job opportunities, etc. Even, the Government of India has embarked on an ambitious program to bridge India&#8217;s digital platform, connect thousands of villages to the Internet and create millions of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital India is the first step that is aimed at transforming the country into a digitally empowered society and a knowledge economy. With the enforcement of Digital India Initiative, India’s internet population has crossed over 465 million and our country has been experiencing rapid strides of progress with an evolving payments landscape, universal access to mobile connectivity, online Aadhar card-linking, Public Internet Access Programme, online ordering, digital jobs and many more internet innovations.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds7OgI5RcKA" width="820" height="344" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second step, </span><b>‘Skill India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ which is supposed to be a multi-skill programme that brings hope for the youth. This fulfills the real agenda to create opportunities, space, and scope for the development of the talents of the Indian youth and to develop more of those sectors which have already been put under skill development for the last so many years and also to identify new sectors for skill development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When Prime Minister Launches SKILL INDIA on the Occasion of World Youth Skills Day, 18,000 plus ITI graduating students received job offer letters on the occasion of World Youth Skills Day where Government sets the target to provide skill training to 40.02 crore people by 2022.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about Indian Economy, India is expected to emerge as one of the leading economies in the World and likely to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025 where the major impetus is being given to strengthening the backbone of our economy by the SME sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of SMEs which is estimated to be at 42.50 million (registered and non-registered together) which will employ about 106 million which is 40% of India’s total workforce. Comprehending the significance of the SME sector vis-a-vis lending numbers to the job market, contribution to GDP and fostering entrepreneurship and innovation, getting skilled under Skilled India Initiative can work as a wonder in all the parameters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the same advancements, the akin learning initiative can aim at bringing the huge gap that exists between the business’ digital skill needs and the availability of professionally trained fresh talents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Prime Minister has launched Nasscom&#8217;s platform &#8211; </span><b>FutureSkills</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; for skill development in eight varied technologies through Video Conference during the inaugural session of the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT)-2018, especially targeting to the youth of our country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, at Modi Ji addressed a State Level Youth Convention at Tumakuru, Karnataka, via video conference, on the theme – </span><b><i>Youth Power: A vision for New India</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He says, he tries his best to meet youth as much as possible, to understand their hopes and aspirations, and work accordingly. He completely believes in the fact that youth are the true pillars of Modern India &#8211; Developed India.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJBAiq2wYcU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why PM Encourages youth for skill development?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the changing world scenario with regard to industry and the job market, there is now an overpowering need for skilled workers degrees. India is relatively young as a nation with around 28 million youth population being added every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 50 percent of its population is below the age of 25 and more than 65 percent are aged below 35. In 2017, The Indian Finance Minister presented his Budget Speech in the Parliament keeping youth engagement as a major working area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education and Skills Development continue to be a development priority and the Finance Ministry has amply provisioned for existing initiatives to be scaled up and newer initiatives to also be launched. The Budget 2017 brings in much more focus on Job creation and Skills Development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because our Govt believes that more we give importance to skill development, the more competent will be our youth as they are the active partners in nation’s development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15211 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-05-at-6.38.50-PM-300x107.png" alt="" width="751" height="268" /></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Digitalization, the Govt claims to skill and up-skill about two million technology professionals and skill another two million potential employees and students over the next few years. The platform offers skilling and upskilling are Digital Marketing (Internet of Things), Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual reality, robotic process automation, big data analytics, 3D printing, cloud computing and social and mobile. With the advent of new technologies, skilling of young professionals is critical.</span></p>
<p>Why is it important to get skills? How can you work to enhance your skills?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill-Based Jobs: About 90 percent of employment opportunities require skills. Only 20 percent of our graduates get employed. The rest are unable to get suitable employment due to the lack of employable skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the present context of globalization, the demand for skilled and multi-skilled workers has increased. This major factor has even encouraged top big companies to do something called <em><strong>Skilled Based Hiring</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to be the part of this developing Digital India, you should enhance your skills according to it. With over 84% 4G network availability, India has emerged as the strong and high potential country in terms of Digitalization and has been constantly on the parallel path to break all the barriers in online marketing. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are living in the era of technology where people prefer to communicate on phones first rather than face to face. For keeping in touch through social media, shopping, hailing a cab, or ordering food, everything starts and ends with smartphones. By making most of it from the same addition of the internet and smartphones, E-commerce is setting trends all over the world.
With $681 billion in online sales in 2016, China is the largest market for e-commerce globally followed by the US, and the India is on the way as the fastest growing one.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11969" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alibaba-Amazon-300x152.jpg" alt="Alibaba-Amazon" width="511" height="259" />
Alibaba is a Chinese e-commerce company that provides consumer to consumer, business to consumer and business to business sales services via web portals which have made a remarkable place in the Asia market with value worth of US$261 billion (2016).
Whereas its world-class competitor, Amazon is an e-commerce as well as cloud computing company, which provides online buy and selling services has made worth revenue of US$135.98 billion (2016).
As per Alibaba’s (which is also known as Amazon of China) founder Jack Ma, the comparison between Alibaba and Amazon make no sense as they both are empires on different pillars and philosophies. Alibaba’s philosophy is to empower other to sell products, services and creating an ecosystem who has partnered with 10 million small business sellers. However, Amazon controls everything, both buy and sells.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11971" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-ma-300x169.jpg" alt="jack ma" width="437" height="246" />
E-commerce company whether it’s Amazon or Alibaba is a like any type of business where buying and selling involve the Internet. As e-commerce industry solely based on the internet, Digital Marketing plays a major role in its growth because it is the only tool that can help in any business growth hacking through digital mediums.
So, how Digital Marketing has played a major role in their success?
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Social Media:</strong> In this crazy world where social media has taken over all hearts, businesses know Social Media is important to thriving internet market strategy. Amazon is quite active on social media in sharing new updates, quickly responds to followers query or frustration and provides a genuine solution to it. Amazon also highlights the products and offers coupons top encourage an increase in sales.</li>
</ul>
<strong> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/amazon-2.jpg" alt="Amazon appstore" width="575" height="291" /></strong>
Same way, Alibaba has tried to shake the perception of social media in China which has helped it more than double revenue. Alibaba Co-founder Joseph Tsai said in the interview, “To capture the attention and imagination of young people you have to provide social features” which is immensely true in every sense.

2)    <strong>E-Mail Marketing:</strong> <em>Ecommerce email marketing is the art and science of using email to generate sales for your store.</em>
It has helped both the companies to stay well connected, informing about discount deals, seasonal sale or festive sale and sending a reminder mail if any user has abandoned their shopping carts which really has helped to shower their concern and worth of a single user is for the company and lead to increase in sales.  Emails act as a catalyst to sales and urge customers to check out successfully before it gets vanished.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/alibaba-email.jpg" alt="Membership Agreement" width="433" height="481" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Mobile/App Marketing:</strong> As per 2016 statistic, Alibaba’s 75% of shopping revenue is contributed by mobile marketing which is huge in itself whereas there is 35% increase in Amazon’s revenue by mobile orders.</li>
</ul>
70% of mobile users spend the majority of their time on their device in apps, which contribute to the growth of mobile commerce over other forms of E-commerce.
Amazon and Alibaba have made big only by following the right pursuit of success with Digital Marketing and win over in their continents by creating right marketing strategies.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/alibaba-amazon-still-no-1-companies/">How Alibaba and Amazon are still No. 1 companies?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Patanjali is like a ménage of products in India now. You can see the television advertisements, hoarding and ad campaigns of Patanjali running all over the way. Patanjali has been rated and reviewed as the “<strong>Best Ayurvedic Indian FMCG</strong> (Fast Moving Consumer Goods)” company, started in 2008 by Baba Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna in India. It has taken an extra special place in people’s hearts and minds by conserving the motto &#8211; <strong>“Prakriti ka ashirward”</strong> (nature’s blessing).
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11886 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/504501-patanjali-logowebsite.jpg" alt="504501-patanjali-logowebsite" width="362" height="197" />
Has anyone wondered how Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali made it’s so unshared and unique place in the market? Let’s dig into the past and find out how Baba Ramdev has created such an exponential history in Indian Market.
<strong>Journey of Baba Ramdev………</strong>
Thousands of people, old and young, used to sit beside their TV and try his yoga exercises to stay fit and healthy. People had known him as a famous personality but hardly few knew about the struggle he had in his early days of life.<strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-11885 alignleft" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/3428-baba-ramdev-0-300x300.jpg" alt="3428-baba-ramdev-0" width="300" height="300" /></strong>
Born as Ramkrishna Yadav on 11 Jan 1965 in the district of Haryana, Baba Ramdev belonged to a poor Indian family. He joined Yoga Monastery (Gurukul) in Khanpur village and started learning the techniques of Yoga.
There, he earned a postgraduate degree with the specialization in Sanskrit Grammar, Hindu Philosophy, Yoga, Vedas, and Upanishads. After Gurukul, he took the Sanyas and changed his name to Ramdev.
After changing his name, he offered free yoga training to villagers across Haryana and with so much self-discipline and meditation; he went to the Himalayas and researched Indian scriptures
He stayed there for several years and become the founder of “<u>Yoga Empire Divya Mandir Trust</u>” with the help of Acharya Karamveer and Acharya Balakrishnan established in 1995, Haridwar.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11891 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/haridwar-300x144.jpg" alt="haridwar" width="500" height="240" />
During the span of time, when Yoga started gaining popularity in western culture, Baba Ramdev became the model of popularizing Yoga in India as well as around the world. He started broadcasting program named “<em>Divya Yog</em>” that airs on Aastha TV.
With his stay in the Himalayas, his interest started in the Ayurveda and he inaugurated “<u>Patanjali Yog Peeth Trust</u>” which is actively engaged in the research for the healing powers of Yoga and Ayurveda.
This trust had provided free services to millions of people which had built a great faith in Ayurveda, Yoga and of course Baba Ramdev.
The trust was acknowledged by many awards and recognitions; and received great funding by Scottish couple of Indian Origin which led to born a brand name – Patanjali.
<em>So, how Patanjali has become the fasted growing Ayurvedic company with the impressive revenues of 5000 Cr. (2015-16) and 1000 dedicated centers all over India (400 in Delhi and 270 in Mumbai)?</em>
<em>What kind of Growth Hacking Strategy followed by Baba Ramdev and his partners to push the Patanjali at top-notch which is only a few years old in the market where companies like Hindustan Unilever and P&amp;G are almost 8 decades old?</em>
Baba Ramdev has acted as a <strong>Brand Ambassador</strong> for Patanjali who single-handedly responsible for its success. As per Baba Ramdev, Patanjali only focuses surpassing information to people that “<em>Revenue of Patanjali is for Charity and not for Brand Owners</em>”, however from any business point of view, it’s a complete organized and fully planned business.
By the virtue of modernization, Baba Ramdev has followed all the parameters of a <em>Growth Hacking</em> in a very subtle but classy way.
<em>Growth Hacking is a process of both conventional and unconventional marketing experiments across the channels and product development to find the effective and efficient ways to grow a business. It’s main focus on building, engaging, converting and retaining the user base of a business.</em>
And Growth Hacker is the “<em>White Hat Hacker of Marketing</em>” whose true north is growth of the company. Here Patanjali’s Growth Hacker is our own Baba Ramdev.
Definition and concept of Growth Hacking were invented by Sean Ellis in 2010. The algorithm revolves around 5 basic stages: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral and Revenue.
<strong><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11884 size-full" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1-PwjoZ9yJ_k2Bo7DpqjF4Lw.png" alt="1-PwjoZ9yJ_k2Bo7DpqjF4Lw" width="794" height="374" /></strong>

<strong>1st &amp; 2nd Stage: Acquisition &amp; Activation:</strong>
Acquisition stage defines how to acquire users from different channels and Activation is when the user decides to take action and use your product.
<em>How Baba Ramdev’s followers become the resource of acquisition -consumers?</em>
Patanjali has a major advantage over other companies as it is associated with a very famous personality – <strong>Baba Ramdev</strong>, who is a health guru followed by famous Bollywood and Hollywood stars.
He is a yoga guru who has untold millions of fan following on Social Media as well as in real life and he is the one who can directly popularize Patanjali through his yoga camps.
Baba Ramdev has direct interaction with the consumers that has created a positive and trustworthy face value of Patanjali and helped to promote the brand even internationally.
Recently Baba Ramdev has promoted his brand on the reality show “<strong>India’s Best Dramebaaz</strong>” which is also sponsored by Patanjali and comedy show “<strong>The Kapil Sharma show</strong>”.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11897 size-full" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-112.jpg" alt="unnamed-112" width="759" height="539" />
He also has a good political support from the BJP government. He was called to lead the World Yoga Day celebration on 21st June 2015 by the Prime Minister himself.
<strong><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11895 size-full aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ramdev_inside_1_1473749634.jpg" alt="ramdev_inside_1_1473749634" width="725" height="460" /></strong>
<strong>Use of Modern Marketing Tool………..</strong>
Digital Marketing has played a major role in the success of Patanjali too. Patanjali is regular in promoting new products through e-mails with the help of Digital Marketing and Content Marketing Tools; Patanjali has attracted consumers by bombarding ads and educating them on the importance of Ayurvedic products through blogs and articles.
His focus is not on proclaiming why Patanjali is the best but he has just shown the reason why to left old products and use new ones.
Not company only, CEO Baba Ramdev is digital himself. He has 541K followers and 5.7 million people on Facebook have liked his page.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11887 size-full" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/50576847.png" alt="50576847" width="644" height="368" />
Unlike other herbal brands, Patanjali has its own brand ambassador as a real life Yoga Guru who preached yoga and Ayurveda all his life and hence their brand identity and brand image has been on the same line.
Once customer trust is earned (through Yoga), reaching them (customers) through products becomes easier.
All these quintessential A-plus following and politics support made him a trust worthy and reliable character which led customers to buy Patanjali’s products without a blink of an eye.
Very smartly, he used his years of struggle and achievements to acquire generic potential customers and has built a well deserved FMCG in competition to all the herbal and FMCG market.
He has set a marvelous example of acquisition and activation of users in the industry in the best possible way.
<strong>3rd Stage: Retention</strong>
Once the user has become an active user of your product, this stage helps the user to come back and stay engage with your product for a longer run.
<strong><em>Nestle Maggi Scam – 2015</em></strong>
In 2015, Maggi- the product of Nestle India, was stamped as “<em>adulterated</em>” product and was banned for consumption by <em>Union Food and Consumer Affairs Minister</em>.
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11892 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Maggi4-600x314-300x157.jpg" alt="Maggi4-600x314" width="300" height="157" />
Same time, Baba Ramdev launched Patanjali&#8217;s Atta Noodles and announced to hit one million stores by the end of December, 2015. He made sure that it would be cheaper than usual Maggi Noodles.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11896 size-full" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ramdev-1457509909.jpg" alt="ramdev-1457509909" width="740" height="520" />
Even Baba Ramdev made a statement in media against FMCG companies that “<em>Multinational firms like Hindustan Unilever, Colgate and Nestle were bringing people to get fake and adulterated products. Patanjali products always tested in labs</em>”.
As a prominent businessman, Baba Ramdev made sure to target the same audience who was holding their anger of betrayal and guided them the importance of natural products of Patanjali.
Along with that, he made an announcement of new categories such as childcare, skincare and healthcare would enter the market to make Patanjali more promising and ideal solution for people.
<strong>Add on factor….</strong>
Prices also played an important role in leashing the growth of Patanjali one step ahead of its competitors. Hindustan Unilever and P&amp;G are trying their best level to cope with the competition however the love for Baba Ramdev and Patanjali are not helping them to even stand in the queue.
Baba Ramdev knows that Patanjali can’t conquer the market with higher prices, so he is educating the people about the benefit of using products as well as comparing the prices with other competitors.
Secondly, the ingredients are natural and domestic; the cost of product and making is lesser as compare to International Products.
In this way, he has retained his consumer&#8217;s faith and made sure he will provide the best, healthy and cheap products keeping the health of people in mind.
<strong>4th Stage: Referral</strong>
When the user starts to refer or recommend your product to friends and shares the positive reviews.
Baba Ramdev has suggested Patanjali’s promotion through media and online campaigns and supported Indian industries by creating demands of Swadeshi Products. He requested political parties and Bollywood to create awareness and strengthen Indian economy by replacing foreign products with Swadeshi Products.
Baba Ramdev made sure his preaching should be available to all in the form of DVDs, Video CDs and magazines and has mastered the art of mass customization and practices so that each individual feels that he is talking to them individually which created a chain of fan following and referred by everyone to grab more learning regarding the importance of healthy life.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11888 size-large" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1426226958_UUCHERATCHAPKEf-714x1024.jpg" alt="1426226958_UUCHERATCHAPKEf" width="714" height="1024" />
Baba has the vision to develop World’s largest food and Herbal Park because of which about 7000 people will get direct and 200000 people will get indirect employment opportunities with this project which has already created hush in the youth.
What else you need to be fan of these companies who promise to offer great product with job stability. This is all what a young generation would need.
<strong>5Th Stage: Revenue</strong>
The most important stage for a company, users fully understand the value of your products and paying for it.
Patanjali is one of the start-ups who have targeted the audiences through two websites mediums: <strong>Corporate and E-commerce.</strong>
In corporate website <strong>.org</strong>, Patanjali shares about the mission and philosophy behind Patanjali &#8211; the use of ayurvedic products.
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11898" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/org-image-1024x560-1-300x153.jpg" alt="org-image-1024x560" width="500" height="254" />

Patanjali has also <strong>.net</strong> e-commerce website through which Patanjali sell products online besides being available with retail chains and under its own distribution centers as per market need.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-11890 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/download-21.jpg" alt="download (21)" width="294" height="172" />
It is the fasted growing Ayurveda Company with the impressive revenues of 5000 Cr by 2016.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11889 size-full aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1461701561-4228.jpg" alt="1461701561-4228" width="350" height="292" />
Patanjali has made a surprising expansion in the FMCG sector with its innovative marketing strategies and has bought a revolution in the industry within a very short period of time. It has been doing great in some of the sectors and products like; Foods including jams, biscuits, noodles, oats, pulses and other food products, beverages, Healthcare &amp; Medicines, personal care products and cleaning agents.

<strong>3<sup>rd</sup> Stage-Retention</strong>:
Once the user has become an active user of your product, this stage helps the user to come back and stay engage with your product for a longer run.
In December, Reliance Jio made another announcement of extending the free package plan till March 2017 in order to retain their existing users and shaped them to get in habitual of this honeymoon period. It has acted like a cherry on the cake to Reliance users and plan named as <em>Happy New Year Plan</em>.

With this strategy, Reliance Jio has become the first ever Telecom Company to provide Six Months of free unlimited services with the focus to conjure revenues.
<strong>4<sup>th</sup> Stage-Referral</strong>:
When the user starts to refer or recommend your product to friends and shares the positive reviews.
Non-Jio also started following the same path as Jio users have recommended Jio to their dear ones and having blast with these free services.
<strong> </strong><strong>5<sup>th</sup> Stage-Revenue</strong>:
Most important stage for a company, users fully understand the value of your product and paying for it.
As free services are about to end by 31<sup>st</sup> March 2017, Reliance Jio has launched <u>Reliance Jio Prime</u> which is an extension program of Reliance Jio.
Reliance Jio users need to subscribe to Jio Prime in which they can get same old free services within Rs 303. Under this plan, subscribers can avail 30GB of 4G data at the cost of Rs 303 which is the ideal plan as compare to other networks.

As Reliance Jio has managed to cross <strong>100 million Subscribers</strong>, they plan to recover the cost of those 6 months within 5 years and start reaping profits.
This whole Growth Hacking Strategy proves that Mukesh Ambani’s main focus to acquire user base with the right vision to provide the best services in cheapest rates and then generate revenue by proving the value of Reliance Jio in the market.

The approach of Reliance Jio is benefitting the users as they are getting twice the value of money while Reliance is confident to procure huge profits with an additional gain of user’s trust and usage.
We hope that reliance will be able to improve on network issues and will create a further win-win for users.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/growth-hacking-strategy-reliance-jio-india/">Growth Hacking Strategy of Reliance Jio, India</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>
