										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">With more young people than ever before setting up in business on their own, many are turning to the internet to share their experiences and grow.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Priyanka Saini was 18 years old when she started working. She took small steps to reach a level where she could work on her business idea. She provided Digital Marketing services to many hospitality brands.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, she was joined by Mohd. Shariq and together they created “Weirdos” initially a Digital Marketing provider and eventually turned into a clothing brand <a href="https://www.weirdo.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weirdo.in</a>.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their social media pages are quite different, often filled with quotes and poetry, to which Priyanka says “through them, the audience feels connected to the brand name in a way”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While launching the clothing line, they aimed to sell 10 t-shirts in a month, they ended up selling much more!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch this young entrepreneurial duo talk about their inspiring journey, social media promotions and running two different ideas simultaneously and earning profits in both!</span>

<b>Nikita-My first question to you is that you’re just 22 years old – Please walk me through your background. How did you come up with the idea and what’s your Education qualification? </b>
<b>Priyanka</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s not even 22, when I started I was just 18. Right after my 12th, I was unsure about what career path I should choose and ended up for Bachelors&#8217;s in computer science. Simultaneously I kept myself engaged in different activities and started working and took up a few internships. Those internships turned into potential clients. The internships were in Content writing and Social Media Marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<b>Nikita- What were your expectations when you started?</b>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The expectation or motivation initially was not to get too big. But to get independent, so I could do things on my own. I wanted to pay for my classes that I was taking like gymnastics. So I wanted those expenses to be covered by taking up internships. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<b>Nikita- Welcome Shariq, my question to you is, how did you two meet and how did you collaborate?</b>
<b>Shariq:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was inspired by Priyanka’s work in college. She was doing multiple internships and getting fit, I was at that time! </span>

<b>Nikita: So, were you both classmates? </b>
<b>Shariq</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: yeah.</span>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So in the first year, we sort of merged.</span>
<b>Shariq:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was more into the technical stuff. I thought I was doing good and I will find a job after B.Tech. But then I saw her, taking care of her expenses and I was living off my father’s money. </span>

<b>Nikita: So that’s when you came up with the idea of Weirdos. Tell me about the name.</b>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was called a weirdo.</span>
<b>Shariq: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">She used to dress very differently and was not personality conscious at all.</span>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So, I was looking for Domain names and did not get any. This sort of came in my mind, I searched for it, it was available and we took it. </span>

<b>Nikita: As I know, it’s a clothing brand but tell me more about the products and services.</b>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The clothing brand is something that came later. How it started- we were offering Digital marketing Services, more in the hospitality industry. Some of them are- Alpina Hotels, Social Street Cafe, Nagpal Jewellers, Detailing Skull, The Vintage Hotels and many more.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So besides that, we were building an audience that could connect to the brand more, because this is something that is service-based and people don’t actually like reading about. So we had our Instagram page for Weirdos wherein we started publishing poetry and quotes page on Instagram.</span>

<b>Nikita: So initially the idea was that you provide Digital Marketing Services to Clients and later on you came up with the clothing brand. So How is that doing?  </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Priyanka: </b>We have like 8k followers on Instagram and we wanted to check if the people that are connected to us would buy something from us or not. That was the time we knew we can launch something for our people. So we came up with the t-shirts range that is quirky and are trying to convert all niches, interest areas to design for.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the whole idea and its launch and the progress indeed was a hypothesis. We needed to have set a goal and outperform that to keep the flow going. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial target was to sell 10 t-shirts within 30 days without any investment in ads or human resources with solely the audience we already had. And 15-20 went into the development of the website post that we could let people know that we have come up with a product range.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was just 10 days now post the launch and we did make 13 sales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now now we knew we are in the right direction and all we need to do is explore new ways to evolve.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<b>Nikita- How is Instagram helping you out in terms of Digital Marketing Services and selling out the clothing?</b>
<b>Priyanka: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two segments that we work on. It’s not that everything is online. Firstly it was a Digital Marketing website now it’s pure e-commerce. The first goal of the 10 sales was purely organic. Out idea was more about touching the strings of the hearts of people so that when they are connected, we can sell the product. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<b>Nikita: Talk about Pinterest?</b>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I love the platform a lot of people are connected to the platform too, the sole idea behind Pinterest too is the same as Instagram but an add on is that it helps us drive organic traffic on the website, which Instagram doesn&#8217;t allow us for now.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<b>Nikita Talk about blogs, how do they help?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Priyanka</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Weirdo is solely around touching the string to people&#8217;s heart and it will always be so the blog section also has poetry and will talk more about styling tips, start-up tips, and a few marketing tips down the line. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we do not want to lose the essence of anything that we are into. We wish to project a real-time picture of what we are to the people connected with us.</span>

<b>Nikita: Plans? What do you target in the future?</b>
<b>Shariq:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Growing our collection for every need, from kids section to wedding collection. From jeans to lehnga to suits and maternity dresses. Like I told you we want the customer to feel at ease while we do the rest for them.</span>

<b>Nikita: What is your message for all the young aspirants who want to start something on their own?</b>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Digital Marketing courses are good, but besides that I want people to be connected with some internships or real-time work as well. Like I started pretty early and did multiple internships and that’s how I learned.   </span>
<b>Shariq:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even today, we face many challenges like website going down, we research and fix it on our own. Continuous learning is important.   </span>

<b>Nikita: A message for all the women out there, who aspire to achieve something big in life?</b>
<b>Priyanka:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You&#8217;ve got it in you and just go for it. Because there were times when I doubted myself if this is the right path. My passion was to develop something that would connect to people as much as possible. So if you have a passion just go for it. It’s not always about the money, it’s about happiness and we are pretty happy. </span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/support-your-brand-through-social-media-marketing-priyanka-saini-mohd-shariq/">Support your brand through Social Media Marketing -Priyanka Saini &#038; Mohd.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Please walk us through your background and tell us how did the idea of starting SquareFoot comes to you? </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I had the idea. Second, came the technology. Then I had to really learn.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I always craved to be the CEO of my own company, I never expected I’d be building my company on the foundation of sound digital marketing. Marketing wasn’t something I knew much about, or really, to be honest, had much interest in. My experience before I founded my company,</span><a href="https://www.squarefoot.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SquareFoot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was in finance and commercial real estate. This industry has long relied on relationships to drive business, not innovation.</span>
<b>What were the challenges for you and  How did you acquire clients? </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, upon launching SquareFoot in 2011, I had to have a serious look at how I was planning to acquire my clients. I had some contacts at my disposal, from several years of working before I went to business school and then started SquareFoot. But that wouldn’t be a long-term plan I could depend on, especially at the beginning before I had built up my client base and established my company name as a viable choice. So I had to do some soul-searching to get people as excited about what I was building as I was to get started looking for office spaces with them in major metropolitan cities.</span>
<b> So, what strategy did you apply? </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to the resource I always use: Google. I began to read about the basics of digital marketing and organic search. Suddenly, it became clear to me that the executives like me would likely be searching online for real estate solutions… because that’s what I knew I’d do when faced with a similar predicament. I invested a lot of time and a small budget into establishing good technical SEO to make SquareFoot a place to turn to when you needed to</span><a href="https://www.squarefoot.com/ny/new-york/manhattan/office-space"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">look for new office space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If people were already searching for what we offered, I figured, I wanted to be there for them on the other side of their searches.</span>
<b> What role does SEO play for your business? </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO isn’t simply about reeling people into your site, though. Good user experience is crucial to success. I quickly realized that I had something they could benefit from &#8211; a commercial listings platform for them to sample free of charge, the first of its kind. If residential listings platforms were popular, it stood to reason that this was the type of thing people would similarly embrace, when the time was right to look around, to assess what different neighborhoods cost, and to turn to us when the time came to show spaces and to complete their deals.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<b>How do you think ways of marketing have evolved and what has changed over the years when it comes to reaching out to people? Also, what has been your approach to clients? </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was arguably easier for me to start my own company, and to build the platform I desired than it was in those early days to find those first clients. I invested, too,</span><a href="https://www.squarefoot.com/blog/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in a company blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where we provided resources and information for the first-time office-seeker to help guide them through a process that can take many months, start to finish. Transparency emerged early on as the backbone through which we would operate. We felt that a more well-informed client case would lead us to have higher-quality conversations and to close deals faster because we weren’t starting at Square One every time. This approach ran contrary to how the industry had opted to run until that point, instead of bundling and packaging the shortage of information publicly available as expertise on the parts of a company’s staff of brokers. We set out to do things differently.</span>
&nbsp;
<b>Considering your background was not marketing, what did you do to master it?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to give myself a masterclass in marketing. I began to research and to understand keywords, to think carefully about audience types and where those particular people hung out online and otherwise, and to develop an area of skills and thinking that hadn’t been my strong suit until that period of time. I sat in on sessions related to how to construct the website and new product offerings that would appeal to algorithms, and to make sure that the direction(s) I took the company reflected and was supported by our online search strategy, too. Marketing would be the mechanism to drive the right people to us, and I had to be the primary leader at the company who displayed an active interest in growing in my own role to uncover and to reveal the additional opportunities.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<b>What will be your advice for aspiring entrepreneurs who want to start now?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re building a company, you often have to work on multiple things at once. As I learned more about digital marketing generally and organic search more specifically, I recognized some similarities between the concepts of that discipline and real estate. Both rely heavily on long-term relationship building. These messages resonated with me because in a way I’d already been doing it. I just hadn’t applied those mechanisms and investments until that point in a digital version toward pursuing business development. We could find more possibilities by offering more to our potential clients. That made a whole lot of sense to me right off the bat. To other aspiring entrepreneurs, I’d recommend having ongoing peeks at and conversations about whether there are dozens if not hundreds of customers waiting for and searching online for a service like yours. If your premise is right, the promise will show itself.</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/first-i-had-the-idea-second-came-the-technology-then-i-had-to-really-learn-jonathan-wasserstrum/">&#8220;First, I had the idea.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[In DigiTalks by Digiperform, Meet <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ankit Dhadwal</span>, Founder &amp; CEO of Mount Woods Studio Pvt. Ltd, a Branding and Consultancy agency, a go-getter entrepreneur, risk-taker, traveler, leader, and so on. His journey is full of wow experiences, treasures, and of course hard work.
we decided to get in touch with him to know more about his passion, work, and team.
<h2><b>1. First, welcome to our industry speak section, DigiTalks by Digiperform. It’s a pleasure to take your interview. Our viewers would like to know about you. Please walk us through your background.</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Digiperform team for creating a platform such as Digitalks where entrepreneurs like me can share their stories with the world. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a renowned Brand Name in the industry and what you guys are doing is very good. So keep it up.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My Name is Ankit Dhadwal and I’m the Founder &amp; CEO of </span><a href="https://www.mountwoods.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mount Woods Studio Pvt. Ltd.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I belong to a beautiful place in Himachal Pradesh called Solan. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have done my Diploma in CSE from Lovely Professional University and Graduated from Rayat Bahara Institute of Technology, Mohali, Punjab in 2015. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I always wanted to become an Engineer and when I completed my Engineering that was a very proud moment for me and my family. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurship was always there in my blood as from my childhood I used to think about running my business one day but at that time I was not clear which business will that be. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also colored stones and pebbles, sold them in my class. Also, my mom is a successful businesswoman of her time and still running her clothing business which is </span><a href="http://www.mountclad.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mount Clad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was pursuing my Diploma, One of my seniors introduced me to blogging and I was so impressed that I wanted to give it a try. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I always loved building beautiful websites so blogging became my area of interest. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So being a coder myself I thought if I’ll learn the basics of digital marketing, it will add extra weight to my resume plus the income generated from it will be the cherry on the cake.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that has helped me a lot in understanding the online market and how it works and currently I&#8217;m living my dreams and working day &amp; night to achieve the milestones that I have set for me and my company Mount Woods Studio Pvt. Ltd.</span>
<h2><strong>2. You are the Founder of Mount Woods Studio. Please tell us about your company, products, and services. Share the foundation with us.</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a Branding and Consultancy agency where we solve design problems faced by businesses. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We help them in building a unique Brand Identity by creating High-Quality Custom Designs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, some people think a logo is just a logo but those who have worked with us understand the value that we are adding to it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a huge misconception that a logo is a brand that is clearly not. It’s a tool to represent your brand to customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where we come in helping them to understand what actually a Brand is and how to build it.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do provide digital solutions globally which include Web Development, UI/UX, Graphic Designing, 2D Animation, Product Photography &amp; Video Production.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about our clientele, we have customers across the USA, Australia and PAN India who have seen significant growth while working with us. From Startups to MNCs We have worked with them all.</span>
<h2><b>3. What is the strength of your company? How you hunt new projects for your company?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Team Members are the real strength of the company as they are the ones who have the same mentality as I do. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all wanted to grow and nurture our knowledge. I can’t do everything on my own so having such team members is like a blessing for me. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have team members who specialize in Graphic Designing, Animation, Creative Directors, Digital Marketing Strategists, and our Founder <strong>Mr. Pankaj Tilara</strong> who is so talented with coding that no matter how hard a problem is, he can solve it smoothly and efficiently.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I am blessed with such great team members similarly we are also blessed with reference from client to client. We do online marketing but most referrals &amp; recommendations work for us. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the power of custom-built work as they are unique and creative that clients refer us. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, most importantly, we believe in building long term business relationships with our clients rather than selling our services to them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where our Consultancy part comes in. We talk before moving ahead and understand their requirements first.</span>
<h2><b>4. How much you believe that digital marketing is evolving in 2020? What are the three trends you would like to suggest to everyone?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m glad that you asked this question. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing in 2020 is the most promising and booming sector where everyone needs to follow the strategies and tactics to survive in the market. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to excel in the field of digital marketing in 2020 then you need to have a decent knowledge of important trends that will affect this industry greatly in 2020.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these trends in 2020 are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Typography &#8211; </b>The more Highlighted your message is, the better it is. Take any website like Godaddy, Dribbble, Netflix, Amazon, etc, you will see bolder text where a clear message is given to their customers about what they do and provide.</li>
 	<li><b>Alt Text &#8211; </b>This was a small thing in the past decade but now Google is focusing a lot more on emphasizing the importance of “Alt Text” and this goes for the images titles as well as other media.</li>
 	<li><b>Page Loading Speed &#8211; </b>One of our clients met with Google team in San Francisco where they clearly said you should have a very good loading speed for every page of your website as in this digital era of high internet speed no one wants to visit a page that takes too long to open.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>5. If someone is operating a startup and looking for various ways to content, what kind of strategy you would offer him/her to follow to deliver the best content and reach out to the maximum audience? Let’s say, one owns a small restaurant. What kind of strategies should be followed, as a marketer and entrepreneur? </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, we have our client </span><b>Aliya Nada Saifi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Pune who was a food blogger and now running Food Delivery Kitchen called </span><b>Roghandaaz</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I met her through Urban clap where we started with logo design and then did full branding for her. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I can relate this question to yours very clearly with her. She is running her business successfully and having a wide range of audiences. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting any business we always suggest to bring your thoughts on paper. This helps you get clarity on what actually you want to do and how you will execute things. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is identifying your customers. If you don’t know who your customers are, what they want, you will end up giving up soon. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have identified your customer then the real challenge is to develop your market which is time-consuming. I believe Your Work Teaches you everything.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aliya Nada did the same thing while working with her, we were in constant touch and communicating with each other on how to proceed further. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the branding part was done, her blogging friends and influencers helped her in building the base of her business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then instead of working on her site, she kept that in 2nd phase as she knew it would take time to get orders directly on her website. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So she opted for Food Delivery Giants like Ubereats, Zomato, Swiggy, etc. which were already having a larger audience, proper CMS and analytics to measure growth rate and revenue. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She developed everything step by step in phases and we were always there to help. Till now, the quality is not compromised which has given them very good ratings on these platforms.</span>
<h2><b>6. Knowing your high professional activity, how do you combine your agenda to fulfill the tasks as a marketer, consultant, and entrepreneur?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not an easy task to put all three on the same plate, so to maintain a proper balance and still combining the agenda we try to put them on different plates and balance them all together to create a beautiful experience which not only satisfies me but the one who we are dealing with. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all its all about customer satisfaction and that’s what matters to me. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they are happy and had an amazing experience working with me, I think I have achieved milestone and moved one step further in my journey.</span>
<h2><b>7. Digital Entrepreneur. Today’s millennial entrepreneurs consider themselves a Digital Entrepreneur? What is your point of view on that?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it’s good to hear and I feel nice about their success. They are on their journey and achieving what they always wanted to. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even I follow people who are doing exceptionally well in this industry and when I compare myself with them, my hunger to gain knowledge increases. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all about the time which is the only key for true success, according to me.</span>
<h2><b>8. How do you see digital marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know that digital marketing is a vast field at this moment and surely it’ll grow in the oncoming future. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think that in the oncoming future we will see people doing specialization in a particular field of Digital Marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But all we can do is speculate according to the current pattern and there might be some major improvements and changes that we may not know but still, we can mold ourselves according to the change.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to me, these trends will always be there which were in the past decades:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specialization</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content was the king and will remain forever.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinks will remain the backbone of the digital marketing community</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>9. As you are aware, Digiperform provides training to people who want to make a career in digital marketing which includes content marketing as well. What exactly you would like to suggest newcomers who are aspiring entrepreneurs.</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to me, if you have made your mind to be on your entrepreneurial journey and are ready to tackle any situation then just go for it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I must say that it will not be an easy journey but that doesn’t mean it’s not achievable. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be many successful failures which you will remember for your entire life but after that, the knowledge and lessons learned will be priceless and no one could have taught you.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digiperform is doing a great job as they are showcasing the experiences of people from where newbies can learn, inspire, grow and try not to commit those mistakes which they did. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is an awesome field where there is no end to learning. Just keep going and keep digging in it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always think you are a newbie even if you have achieved a lot because there will be someone else who has the same mentality to grow and nurture his/her skills.</span>
<h2><b>10. According to you, what are the various ingredients for a successful digital marketer and entrepreneur?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the grass is always greener on the other side and for those who think you will enjoy a lot when running your business think 10 times again. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 9 to 5 jobs, you only handle the pressure of work but still able to enjoy time with family. But in Entrepreneurship, you have to handle a lot of things at the same time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the college drop-outs think it is Cool to start their own business but once you enter it, there is no going back. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the month-end, you have to worry about the office rents, employees&#8217; salaries, clients, 24/7,365 days of work, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a strong mental balance is very necessary which develops with time and your patience will be tested every day. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has his own perks and benefits which you will receive after years of learning and a vision.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I always wanted to start my own business and I have seen my Mom working hard day and night for us. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I had an idea about this but real challenges came when I entered fully into it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to me there are 3 main ingredients for becoming a successful Entrepreneur and this can be related to any field like being a Digital Marketer:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Consistency</b></li>
 	<li><b>Learning Attitude</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no matter what position you are at</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your best shot and no matter what it takes </span><b>Never Give Up</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></li>
</ul>
<em><strong>&#8220;Dreams is a foundation of every castle&#8221; so just go for it.</strong></em>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <a href="https://digiperform.com/digitalks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigiTalks by Digiperform</a> industry speak section, we used to share the personal as well as professional experiences of digital industry experts which included entrepreneurs, bloggers, YouTubers, etc.
From going forward, we would also be sharing the real experiences of working professionals who have decided to take a step ahead to shape their career in the digital marketing industry irrespective of their degrees.
Likewise, in this post, we have shared the one-on-one discussion with an <em>SEO &amp; Content Manager</em> who is currently working with India&#8217;s leading digital marketing agency, <em><strong>Convomax Digital</strong></em>.
<h2><strong>Meet Tejas Shahakar.</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-24166 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/author-headshot.jpeg" alt="Tejas Shahakar" width="270" height="360" />
He&#8217;s a B.Tech Graduate (Computer Science) who has a great passion for writing since his school. Instead of pursuing his career in the IT industry, he decided to follow his passion for writing and grow with it.
We decided to get in touch with him and asked about his ambitions, journey and Why he had chosen SEO over all other digital parameters. Have a look!
<h4 class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span class="s1">Digiperform- Hi </span><span class="s2">Tejas</span><span class="s1">. First, welcome to our industry speak section, DigiTalks By Digiperform. It’s a pleasure to have your interview. Our readers would like to know about you. We would like to know about both, professional and not-so-professional </span><span class="s2">Tejas</span><span class="s1">.  </span></strong></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas-</strong> Hello, first I would like to thank team Digiperform for giving me this opportunity. You guys have an amazing presence in Digital Marketing Training among the people out there. It&#8217;s my pleasure to interact and share my expertise with you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since my school days, I have always loved languages. It is such a fascinating medium to convey what you feel, so easily, I felt. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later, during my graduation, I tried my hand at writing content for some of my friends and I developed an inclination towards writing. That was the time content writing as a career option started brewing up in my mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That time, Digital Marketing was a comparatively new field. To be honest, I was confused but I was sure about not choosing IT as a career option. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was a big NO for me. I kept exploring for a while and then my interest drove me towards SEO and Content Marketing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to me, everything around us is content which we consume in the form that best suits us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That being said, I chose a digital marketing career because we can arrange and put forward the content in front of the people, ethically, to help them make decisions.</span></p>
This made me feel through this career option, I could live my dream career and follow my passion for writing.
<h4 class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span class="s1">Digiperform- You are currently working as an SEO and Content Manager at Convomax Digital. Generally, people hesitate to choose an SEO stream and work for the same. What made you choose SEO as your career?</span></strong></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas- </strong>For a couple of years after graduation, I tried my hand in other aspects of digital marketing – PPC, Social Media, etc. This is where generally most of the pursuers go and I too went with the flow to gain experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, as I got to understand, my focus shifted towards SEO. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have always believed to work on things from bottom-up and strengthening the core first. As it happens SEO sits at a very basic level of any online business and serves as a foundation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also, I think <em>SEO as a gentle giant like an Elephant. It is slow, gradually growing day-by-day, needs a lot of patience, but once it&#8217;s mature enough it can dominate the landscape around</em>.</span></p>

<h4></h4>
<h4 class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span class="s1">Digiperform- Taking care of both SEO and Content is not that easy. Especially, when SEO keeps on fluctuating every day. Like, Google is famous for updating and creating new rules for organic results. How you keep yourself motivated for the same?</span></strong></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas- </strong>Indeed, SEO and Content is a real hustle. Keeping an eye out for any algorithm changes seems like a rather monotonous task. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In SEO, you do it right or be prepared to lose everything you have worked for, after that algorithm update where businesses have crashed in just one day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My motivation comes from the fact that I would like to keep businesses unaffected by such algorithm changes and that is the beauty of it.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span class="s1">Digiperform- It’s said, “Content is the kind of marketing”. How much you agree with it? And, Why?</span></strong></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas- </strong>As I have said earlier, everything around us is content in a variety of forms which we consume in bits and pieces that is the most relevant to us. We normally use the content as a reference for the solution we need for a particular situation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketing is a way to craft that content in an organized way to aid us in finding the perfect solution to our needs. Thus, ‘<em><strong>content is a kind of marketing</strong></em>’.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h4 class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span class="s1">Digiperform- How much SEO and Content are related to each other. Which one has bigger role to play as per your experience and why?</span></strong></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas- </strong>Content is the core of any marketing strategy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s just say content is the essence of SEO and SEO is the essence of any digital marketing strategy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SEO and content can’t be separated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All the answers we need are found in the content and SEO is the means to help you find those answers in the quickest way possible. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thus, SEO and content both have an important role to play and they complement each other.</span></p>

<h4></h4>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- If someone is operating a startup and looking for various ways to rank first, what kind of SEO and content strategy you would offer him/her to follow to deliver the best content and reach out to the maximum audience? Let’s say, someone owns a club. What kind of strategies should be followed, as a digital marketer?</strong> </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas- </strong>SEO proves to be one of the most fun and challenging aspect to make a startup successful. It is a lengthy process and needs time before it starts showing results. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To start with, <em><strong>keyword research</strong></em> would be the foremost important thing to carry out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any online business, new or established, will only work if you provide your prospects with answers they seek for. Keyword research will help you understand what exactly they want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Further, all the elements of the on-page SEO should be optimized keeping in mind the keywords. These include page titles, meta-tags, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we proceed with the SEO process, the next thing to focus on is the technical aspects of a website that include the URL structure, internal linking, optimizing the website for individual page load time, the mobile-friendliness and the XML sitemap.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once this is done, one can move on to establishing and increasing the website authority. This is done by gaining backlinks from other sites and is also called off-page SEO.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These things work for every business in general. For a club, focusing on the long-tail keywords that the club going people might search for, the kind of content needed would be trendier and which will go well our generation and optimizing the website for Local search would be some of the specific aspects to focus on.</span></p>
For beginner&#8217;s, I would recommend reading- <a href="https://digiperform.com/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-seo-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Complete Free Beginner&#8217;s Guide to SEO Marketing</a>, written by me. It has all the necessary concepts to understand SEO and what kind of things you should follow to grow your business digitally.
<h4 class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span class="s1">Digiperform- How much you believe that SEO is evolving in 2019? What are the three trends you would like to suggest to everyone?</span></strong></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas- </strong>SEO is an ever-changing and evolving process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the search algorithms constantly improving for search, firstly having structured data markup on the website would be advantageous since AI is becoming increasingly popular.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secondly, optimizing the website for mobile pages would be a wise choice as most of the traffic to a website comes from mobile devices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we discussed earlier that the content is at the core of any marketing strategy, search audience is also evolving and becoming intelligent in terms of putting forward what they exactly need. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thus providing quick answers to user queries using a variety of content forms like infographics, images, etc.</span></p>

<h4></h4>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- As you are aware, Digiperform provides training to people who want to make a career in digital marketing which includes content marketing and SEO as well. What exactly you would like to suggest a newcomer who wants to make a career in SEO or something like that.</strong> </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tejas- </strong>Of course, Digiperform is a reputed digital marketing institute among the others out there and has a vast presence in that domain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The newcomer is always at an advantage as there are immense possibilities to gain knowledge. For starters, there are no boundaries to keep experimenting and learning new things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep yourself updated with the trends by reading blogs, listening to podcasts, and try out different strategies in all the domains and gain as much experience as possible.</span></p>
<em><strong>Digiperform:</strong></em>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Content marketing is a commitment, not a campaign.</strong></em>
This is well accompanied by one of the growing entrepreneur and content strategist &#8211; <strong>Shivang Sinha</strong> who believes he&#8217;s a &#8220;<em>Born Entrepreneur</em>&#8220;.
Shivang is the co-founder of <a href="https://alphabetfactory.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Alphabet Factory</strong></a> and leading <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://vocabberry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vocabberry </strong></a>who </span>develops a strategy for delivering content for audience across all platforms with a focus on constant experimentation and thoughtful recalibration based on findings. His role requires strong analytical skills, excellent communication, and has an interest in the technology, innovation, and editorial worlds. I analyze digital performance and devise a future roadmap in accordance.
In our industry speak section, <strong>DigiTalks By Digiperform</strong>, we decided to get in touch with him personally and ask for his journey from college students to Digital Entrepreneur.
Have a look and we hope his life and experiences will help others to motivate and feel confident in their abilities.
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- Hi Shivang. First, welcome to our industry speak section, DigiTalks By Digiperform. It’s a pleasure to take your interview. Our readers would like to know about you. We would like to know about both, professional and not-so-professional Shivang. </strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> Thanks for having me on this platform and giving me the privilege to share my story.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/7cbfe942-b733-4951-aa3a-9b152b10c390.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23896 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/7cbfe942-b733-4951-aa3a-9b152b10c390.jpeg" alt="shivang sinha" width="251" height="377" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about myself, I always wanted to be an entrepreneur since school. Always had fun in being able to sell things and make some profit. I even started selling pens in school when I was in 6th standard for a profit of INR 1-2/pen and made some 20-30 bucks each day. Later, started giving tuitions in class 9th through 12th to fuel my desire to keep buying clothes and accessories. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always wanted to get into Pharma so took up pharmacy as a professional career while still writing content for references, mostly paid. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, after my first startup went down due to operational issues, I started working at Vocabberry full-time to serve the intent of great content and deliver valuable content solutions to clients. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The intent to serve clients with quality content raised while working with international and national brands such as Fresenius Kabi and Biocon. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced content was mostly never of value and hence, it never saw the light of the day when it came to publishing the same. What started with <em><strong>Vocabberry</strong></em> was propelled further by <em><strong>Alphabet Factory</strong></em> &#8211; specialized content creation and marketing platform not just for B2B, B2C or D2C segments but also for e-learning. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from this, love to make and listen to music, write poetries, read influencer blogs on entrepreneurship and business ethics, trade and more. Love to travel. I am a lean traveler. I can travel as soon as the next hour! Hahaha!</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- What you would like to call yourself, Marketer, Public Speaker, Columnist or Content Strategist? And, why?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> I would like to call my self a marketer because of my ability to blend with people quickly and share opinion and thoughts basis the surroundings. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a marketer, I possess the etiquette of public speaking (something I love) about content, business processes and more. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The same applies to be a Columnist or a content strategist. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a marketer is a constant hustle. You have to remain updated about everything in business and whatever is trending for the shortest span. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, a marketer is everything &#8211; a speaker, a columnist, a strategist and whatever you may like to call. </span>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- You are a Co-founder of Alphabet Factory and leading Vocaberry as well. Please share about both the companies. Share the foundation and what kind of services you provide.</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> With Alphabet Factory, the aim was to further the vision of serving quality content to not just B2B and B2C segments but also to Universities and Corporates. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We realized the value of quality content was missing when it came to eLearning courses that the university and corporates were taking. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Alphabet Factory, we aim to deliver emerging technology courses ranging from AI to IoT and whatever one needs to learn at the same time other courses like POSH, Soft Skills and other personality development courses to help achieve personal as well as professional goals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vocabberry is a creative content solutions company and the domain is entirely different from Alphabet Factory. At Vocabberry, the aim is to deliver content that creates an impact on the brand and helps the brand to reach out to the maximum. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- It’s said, “Content is the king of marketing”. How much you agree with it? And, Why?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> I agree with the fact because the content is the next big thing when it comes to marketing and as the guru of content marketing, Seth Godin said &#8211; &#8220;<em>Content marketing is the only marketing left&#8221;</em>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The civilization is bent on reading(blogs/articles/news), watching(videos, snippets, podcasts, films), listening (radio, podcasts, Voice messages) and following graphical form of content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, it is evident to market the right form of content and put strategies to use that can define the authenticity of the content created. Keep chewing content, we will keep creating it. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- If someone is operating a startup and looking for various ways to content, what kind of strategy you would offer him/her to follow to deliver the best content and reach out to the maximum audience? Let’s say, one owns a small restaurant. What kind of strategies should be followed, as a marketer and entrepreneur? </strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> The strategy is always strong on paper and fails when executed incorrectly. While I aim at delivering and framing exceptional strategies it is about how the person executes it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To the owner of a small restaurant, I would suggest going with the story of the brand. Storytelling always works wonders. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner should talk about why and when he opened the restaurant. What is the ulterior motive and how is he serving in the best interest of everyone. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then usual things like &#8211; how is he solving the problem? What is different in his restaurant? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from this, market the unmarketable &#8211; talk about the chefs, market the dishes on a daily basis. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Give the dishes a funky name and probably offers discounts if the customers posted a picture with the dish on Instagram tagging the restaurant. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I would always go for a very personalized approach. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- How much you believe that digital marketing is evolving in 2019? What are the three trends you would like to suggest to everyone?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> Digital Marketing is getting all the pros from the likes of technology growth and especially when it comes to AIML (Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language) and marketing automation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 and 2020 will be a fruitful year in terms of growth and recognizing newer models of content marketing and its forms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three trends considering the commercial aspects would be <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-content-marketing-course-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content marketing</a> with defined customer cycle and other technicals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Second would be AI, I believe the most popular marketing applications will enhance personalization and marketing automation which brings us to the third trend which is engagement-based email automation. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- As you are aware, Digiperform provides training to people who want to make a career in digital marketing which includes content marketing as well. What exactly you would like to suggest a newcomer who wants to make a career in content writing or something like that. </strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> Of course, Digiperform has been reasonably seen as one of the premier institutes in providing training to people.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For newcomers, I would suggest keeping indulging in experiential learning and reading &#8211; whenever possible. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to podcasts, blogs, go to Blinkist or any such app and keep yourself updated with the latest trends in all domains. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having written in almost all domains, I draw my knowledge and inspiration from reading and listening to industry updates. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform- Any suggestion you would like to give to our readers and trainees as well. </strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Shivang-</strong> Suggestion would be to keep reading, keep yourself updated with the latest protocols and algorithm changes related to SEO and Instagram and Facebook marketing. The trends help you stay upbeat in the dynamic social media age. </span>

<strong>Digiperform:</strong>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Entrepreneurship is neither a science nor an art. It&#8217;s Practice. &#8211; Anonymous</strong></em>
This has been well accompanied by one of the entrepreneurs of Ahmedabad, Atman Rathod.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rathodatman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atman Rathod</a> is the Director &amp; Co-founder of <a href="https://www.cmarix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMARIX </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technolabs Pvt. Ltd. which is a </span>process technology company based out from Ahmedabad, India. They are leading technology disruption with clients across 46 countries globally. They are a premium technology outsourcing company with in house team of 115+ engineers and provide turnkey solutions in terms of all your technology needs.
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/atman-rathod.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-23802 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/atman-rathod.jpeg" alt="atman rathod" width="357" height="357" /></a>
In our industry speak section, <strong>DigiTalks By Digiperform</strong>, we decided to get in touch with him personally and ask for his journey from college students to Digital Entrepreneur.
Have a look and we hope his life and experiences will help others to motivate and feel confident in their abilities.
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Hi Atman Rathod! How are you? Briefly share about yourself, your hobbies, likes or dislikes, previous experiences…..etc. and your professional life as well, in your words.</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> Hello Digiperform team, Thank you for this opportunity. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What keeps me going is the constant love for learning new things, reading in regards to different subjects from physics to Metaphysics or from business to economics. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, nature, exercising and an endeavor to improve me at every moment makes my journey more interesting. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2002, during my college life, I came across a book “<em><strong>You Can Win</strong></em>” <em><strong>by Shiv Khera</strong></em>, which was the first book that sparked something and made me feel that I realize the potential hidden within me for outstanding personal and professional growth. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It brought me out from the common perception people have today “<em>life is a merger of two phases i.e. personal and professional&#8221;</em>. However, I believe we have one life and we have only one to live it. So, no matter who we are – we are at work and at home. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last decade, brought to me a plethora of experience while reading more than 300+ books including top authors like Anthony Robbins, Brian Tracy, Osho, Sadguru, Robert Kiyosaki, Leo Tolstoy, Robin Sharma, Zig Ziglar, Lao Tzu, Confucius, Robert Green and many more. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Life becomes beautiful when you pick up things, absorb and implement it. This is the power of learning and growing. I see myself as a student of life and go about living it in the most holistic way as I can.  </span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Kindly share about CMARIX TechnoLabs Pvt. Ltd. Also, briefly share the core foundation of CMARIX and its amazing team. </strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> The essential idea of getting CMARIX Technolabs Pvt. Ltd. company into existence was to build a company whose core foundation is known for its client-centric, employee-centric culture and an optimistic attitude. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have developed a result-driven work culture while constantly enhancing better technology delivery standards of India. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see ourselves in the top 25% league of companies who have expertise in our business domain. Not because of the number of employees or the total turnover, but the actual thing that matters is the work culture of the company, passion, benchmark, and vision. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned early in my career that organizational culture is the most important and non-tangible part of any organization. It can build or break the company. We have a great culture here at CMARIX which is the core essence of our success and we take active steps to constantly enrich it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are among the very few companies who have 80% of the manpower with more than 4+ years of experience. The kind of projects which we work for is not a cup of tea for non-technical or a fresher. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our core strength, i.e. our team comprises of technology experts, domain experts, SCRUM masters, Design-led engineers, Digital marketing professionals and several other work profiles that together form a resilient &amp; one-stop solution team. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a pride in acknowledging the fact that we have one of the smallest sales team when referred to any IT company in Gujarat. The core reason behind this is, we are a complete development-centric company. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The work speaks and probably that is why they stay with us for long. We ensure we do whatever it takes to add tremendous value and not only provide service delivery but to transform their business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the key reason that motivated us to start this company and the core essence of our success mantra. </span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: What is your typical day out as a passionate Director, Investor, and Startup consultant and of course a loving father?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> Nice question. This is often something I ask during the interviews as I believe this is the best way to know a person. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My day starts with the gym and hitting the office right after. I prefer micro-managing the execution as much as I can as it helps me build great leadership within the company. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have quick standup SCRUM meetings with various department heads which includes Development Delivery, Design, Marketing, HR, Sales, Accounts, and Operations. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the management aspect is taken care I use the afternoon hours to do meetings with our global partners as well as providing consultation to my enterprise clients. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I use late afternoon to improve “processes” and “people” as they are the two core elements of this organization. My late evenings are spent taking reporting of the planned work to ensure its completion and smooth execution. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always motivated a team to complete days’ work in given time of 8 working hours. To us, if someone is sitting in the office late in the evening it means they haven’t skillfully completed the work in the given time and need improvement. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We never encourage “staying late in office” to be interpreted as “working hard”. We believe in smart work and I want everyone associated with us to have a good work-life balance. It’s very important for person and professional time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, another interesting thing is, I have got a house in the same building as my office which saves me the need to buy a car. I can just walk to the office in 3 min. I think I am saving around 1 hour of traveling time during the workday which I can spend playing with my 3-year-old kid when I reach home in the late evening. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, I believe it’s very important to give time to kids as they are building blocks of the nation and it is our core responsibility on how we are raising our kids as they drive the result in the next generation &amp; one who will take charge of our great country – India.  </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cmarix.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23804 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cmarix.jpg" alt="cmarix office" width="624" height="416" /></a>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Your expertise involves working with customers across 80+ countries globally and providing services of Enterprise custom software, Website design &amp; development as well as Mobile Application Development (as per LinkedIn). Our readers would like to know more about the journey.</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> After doing my engineering in Information Technology from Saurashtra University I went to London to pursue my further studies which included a certificate in business management and Master of Science in Management from Middlesex University, London, Hendon Campus. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After I finished my masters, I worked in London for a few years. I believe it was a very important part of my experience as I had the opportunity to study, work and live with people from across the globe. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I understood the service delivery perception of people in the west and how we can adjust the cultural difference to bring people on the same ground and ensure a win-win relationship between different stakeholders. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, I have traveled personally to over 22 countries across the globe and providing technology services to startups, SMEs, Enterprise and Fortune 100 companies. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now we have different clients across the globe and often I speak and work with clients in the remote island who are looking for technology solutions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have had more changes in the last 20 years on how things are implemented virtually, every aspect of life as compared to the last 500 year in human history. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most exciting time in the world to live in and I am very grateful to be one of the essential contributing parts of this changing ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: You company had been ranked among top 3 Best Software Development Companies of Gujarat State by Gujarat Electronics and Software Industries Association (GESIA). What makes CMARIX the best of all?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> The answer is in operations. Right from how we take interviews, select the right people. Get them into the right processes to work on the type of projects which we want to work on and bring about the result which amazes our customers, thereby providing the work environment, compensation, and other benefits to our team. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our selection criteria are never solely based on the technical skillset of people. We always look for that raw material with good fundamentals and passion for learning and bringing results. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where, we give them necessary mentors, training, work environment and everything else that is required to bring the right results. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We love our employees and our customers and as a Management our job is to ensure there is a very positive cycle of value delivery between them to generate tremendous results and outstanding performance. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-17-at-2.22.56-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23803" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-17-at-2.22.56-PM.png" alt="Team of Cmarix" width="1352" height="621" /></a>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Do you believe that Technology and Online Marketing can go hand-in-hand? If yes, how do you see technology and marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> In the current information and tech era, everything is connected. Online marketing is mandatory. Yes, technology and online marketing have a great future together.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, you can consider the growing trend of automation is marketing. Digital marketing is one of the fastest-growing marketing channel and the domain that needs a lot of investment at the start, irrespective of their business domain. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, the trend that I can potentially sense &amp; visualize is the real-time functioning of development for a specific marketing endeavor. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers won’t just have to stay bound to the writing and presentation skills, but they need to have a complete know-about of different platforms and strategies to attract the audience for the specific innovation, service or event. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New channels of targeting specific audience will come into place in the future and the markers need to be wise to analyze the platform &amp; plan before time in order to reap the rewards. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, to leverage any opportunity – you need to be at the right place at the right time. </span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: As your company is into mobile app development, why you feel startups should adopt this trend? What makes mobile development and online marketing a necessity for startups?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> In the upcoming 10 years the amount of mobile phone usage by people across the globe will be increased gradually. Thanks to the advent of smartphones, advanced technology and easy access to the internet that makes take life to convenience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At any moment, information is readily available and mobile apps act as a virtual assistant for everyone. We can do anything and everything with a mobile. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the endeavor is to order food, search for a job, find a place to leave, search for rent place, banking, insurance, looking out for cab and almost everything. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People want everything right beside them with ease, and mobile apps fulfill this aim. Without any doubt, the trend for developing unique and better apps is growing and a new idea is nothing without marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the growth of app development and marketing is certainly big and entrepreneurs should embrace this change for their startup. </span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: According to you, what are the various ingredients required if someone wants to start his/her own venture?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> #1. Strong reason. Don’t tell me “money” is the reason for starting a venture. If it is then it won’t be successful in the long run also it is not the right reason for any service delivery. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurs need to have the passion and attitude to solve the problem in the right way, they need to know how they can reach their goal by adopting different strategies with selected resources. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">#2. Constant and Never-ending improvement behavior. As they say “kaizen”, a key Japanese principle for any business that will help you stay successful once you have become successful. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">#3. Give back – success comes with responsibility. It’s very important that you give back to society, people, country, world, and universe as it would complete the success circle. </span>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Any suggestion you would like to give to our readers and students?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Atman:</strong> We all are very lucky generation. As mentioned above, we are living in the information era and there are more potential and surprising changes in the upcoming 20 years than the last 500 years in this world. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read, Learn, Experiment. Time is precious and utilizes every moment to grow. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be a good student, a good professional, a good citizen and most important a good human being. Life is much bigger than we think it is and the universe is much generous than it looks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/263a.png" alt="☺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;Entrepreneurship is the freedom to do what you want, when you want and how you want.&#8221;</strong></em></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the people think entrepreneurship comes from studying top B-Schools or reading a lot of business books. To be honest, these big town studies can bring lots of transformation in your marketing strategies, but real entrepreneurship is a skill that depends on the approach you choose to grow your business; which can also be inherited with other people&#8217;s experiences. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, one should have the interest to know other entrepreneurs&#8217; stories; like, how they got succeeded or how they failed. Each story has its own risk elements and strategies that define their win or lose situation. Like, you will find entrepreneur skills even in roadside fruit seller or in top-class company holder. Its all about the matter of fact that at what scale you want to take your entrepreneur dream. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, we believe every person who wants to start his/her entrepreneurial journey needs complete guidance, support, and inspiration. Therefore, in this post, we will take you to stories of <strong>Top 4 entrepreneurs</strong> who have started from the basic in the digital world and worked hard to be known as successful entrepreneurs. And, they call themselves, <strong>Digital Entrepreneurs</strong>. </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every Startup has a different story that captures the risks, challenges and human efforts to turn big dreams into products and services that make the world better.
And, in <a href="https://digiperform.com/digitalks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigiTalks By Digiperform</a>, we believe to share these stories with our trainees and readers to help them follow their entrepreneurial dream.
In this industry speak, we are introducing you to the Founder &amp; CEO, who has been into various industries and currently helping new brands to fulfill their big brand dreams.
Meet <strong>Deepak Sharma</strong>, an entrepreneur, consultant and founder of a marketing company, <strong>WithStartUps.com</strong>.
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-03-at-12.51.10-AM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-23625 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-03-at-12.51.10-AM.png" alt="Deepak Sharma" width="290" height="363" /></a>
In this segment, he has shared about his professional journey, the foundation of his company and current projects he is managing. Here is the transcript of the conversation we had with Deepak. Have a look!
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Hi Deepak Sharma. Briefly share about yourself, your hobbies, likes or dislikes, previous experiences…..etc. in your words. </strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> Hey, First I would like to thank Team Digiperform for giving this opportunity. I &amp; My whole team of WithStartUps is thankful. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about me, I have been in lots of industries over the years. Starting from merchant ships and then moving on to technology and marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have worked in diverse sectors that have allowed me to view any problem from multiple angles. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, I am building a cloud server management platform (<em><strong>InfraGuard</strong></em>) and creating a top-notch digital marketing team at </span><a href="https://www.withstartups.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">withStartups.com</span></a>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Please tell us about WithStartUps.com. Also, share the foundation of the company? How it got started? What type of services you provide?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> WithStartUps.com actually started as an entrepreneurship blog where I would interview emerging founders from India like you have been currently doing. ROFL!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, as I started going deeper into digital marketing and growth hacking, the website too molded into something bigger. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we are one of India’s top digital marketing companies working with everyone from large brands to smaller startups. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our core differentiators are <em>Influencer Marketing</em> &amp; <em>Celeb Endorsements</em> on one end, supplemented with the more stable services of <em>SEO and Social Media Marketing</em> on the other end. </span>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0DqDeJpWM8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23620 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-02-at-11.52.51-PM.png" alt="Influencer" width="602" height="385" /></a>
<h4><strong>Digiperform: You have shared the profiles of your team on your website. No doubt, you have an amazing team. Please tell something about your team? </strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> We have an exciting young team that is growing rapidly. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company, we took a conscious decision to hire people based on skills as well as a long term vision. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a typical startup, everyone in our team is multi-tasked. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have people who are Google, AWS, and Azure certified. </span>
<a href="https://www.withstartups.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23624 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-03-at-12.51.01-AM.png" alt="Team WithStartups" width="651" height="525" /></a>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Knowing your high professional activity, how do you combine your agenda to fulfill the tasks as a marketer, consultant, and entrepreneur?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> To me, the critical skill for any entrepreneur is <strong>Time Management</strong>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to get lost in the work if you do not structure your daily tasks. I am a big believer in planning the week beforehand and setting up automated task tracking as much as possible. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, being able to delegate the work to a skilled team helps a lot. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend to divide our work into weekly and monthly targets. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That structure helps everyone to stay focused and also correct if we feel that any particular task is getting delayed. </span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Digital Entrepreneur. Today’s millennial entrepreneurs consider themselves a Digital Entrepreneur? What is your point of view on that?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> The world has gone fully digital so I agree with this term. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any entrepreneur, even if he or she is operating in a traditionally offline industry, has to be digitally savvy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a few years back it was unthinkable to be able to launch a startup and get access to an audience of millions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, this is fairly easy. Even in our team, we often do internal projects where we do a full concept launch of a website and social media within a week. </span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: How do you see digital marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> Digital will become the mainstay of marketing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every brand will have to understand that this will be the primary customer acquisition channel. </span>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In 2019, the trends of  Influencer Marketing and Videos will keep occupying the center stage.</strong> </span></em>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the internet being freely available (credit to Reliance Jio), India is seeing a huge change in media consumption pattern. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New influencers are coming up and video creation is getting easier. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The third trend I would forecast is traditional &#8211; I would say that <strong><em>SEO will see a resurgence</em></strong>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands are realizing that this channel simply cannot be ignored. </span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Being a founder of a digital agency, you must have handled different kinds of projects. Tell us something about the projects you have been doing or completed so far? </strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> We do a lot of projects at any time. Something that we are particularly passionate about is the new brands that we have launched. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them is <em><strong>withWeddings.com</strong></em> that is focused on the wedding segment in India &#8211; brides, fashion &amp; lifestyle. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is picking up and getting a huge engagement. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one is <em><strong>theIndianbeards.com</strong></em>, this is focused on the Men’s fashion segment. </span>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzNTazBJJej/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23619 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-02-at-11.51.48-PM.png" alt="Indianbeards.com" width="745" height="477" /></a>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: What makes WithStartUps &#8211; the Leading Digital Marketing Agency in Delhi NCR?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> We are completely transparent with the client. We do not overpromise and are fully data-backed. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every week, we send sophisticated reports that ensure that everyone is on the right page. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This combined with an extremely skilled team ensures that we create long term relationships with our clients. </span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: According to you, what are the various ingredients for a successful digital marketer and entrepreneur?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> You must have a clarity of vision. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not change your goalposts, as an entrepreneur or as a digital marketer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a clear aim, and then figure out how to achieve it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There will always be problems and there will always be excuses. It is up to you to find the solutions. </span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Digiperform: Any suggestion you would like to give to our readers and students who want to make their career in digital marketing?</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:</strong> Yes, get as much practical experience as possible. The theory is one thing, but actually doing the stuff is quite another. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days it is extremely simple to set up a website and a social media page. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your own brand, and implement what you learn. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will make you much more ready to face the challenges of the real world. Plus, you will create a provable project to show to employers.</span>
&nbsp;
<strong>Digiperform:</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about myself, I always wanted to become an Entrepreneur and doing a regular job was not my thing. So, here I am, a Founder of Spark Eighteen Pvt. Ltd.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love having a good cup of coffee and enjoy hanging out with my friends at different coffee shops in Delhi. And, I started my entrepreneurial journey way back in high school. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I, along with a friend, built a few designs to compete with the sweatshirt trend and made a million bucks in revenue.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also ventured into a product business with <em><strong>Cookfresh</strong></em> (food tech space). At Cookfresh, we used to provide ready to cook gourmet meals at home. Those were amazing days!</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: Please tell us about Spark Eighteen. Also, share the foundation of the company? How it got started?</b></span></h4>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: Knowing your high professional activity, how do you combine your agenda to fulfill the tasks as a marketer, consultant, and entrepreneur?</b></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aayush: </strong>Being a goal-oriented person, I believe to prepare, configure and strategize to bring out the best results in my every project. </span>
As an entrepreneur, it&#8217;s my duty to provide my knowledge and vision to make sure my team is on at the same stage. I have learned that one should be transparent to his/her team if he/she is really seeking out a dream goal.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a goal-oriented digital marketing company, we believe in preparing, planning and project management to maximize brand promotion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide businesses an extra edge by bringing down the costs relative to the revenues.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a marketer, I make sure, first me, then my team stays updated as per the market trends. Every day new marketing tactics keep popping up making it tough for the businesses to stay on top of the newest trends, so by figuring out the best ways to use different platforms, we master the different areas of digital marketing.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: What makes Spark Eighteen – the Best Digital Marketing Agency in Delhi?</b></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aayush: </strong>Our belief in unleashing insights and blending data, strategy, and sharp marketing expertise to drive the best results for our clients&#8217; business is what makes us the Best Digital Marketing Agency in Delhi. </span>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: Tell us something about the projects you have been doing or completed so far?</b></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aayush: </strong>Haha! Ideally, we don&#8217;t share our projects and secrets. But I would definitely like to give an insight into one of our recent successful projects. </span>
<h4><b>Project Name</b><strong> &#8211; <a href="https://www.sparkeighteen.com/portfolio/geminus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geminus</a></strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geminus is the world’s first industrial process-centric digital twin product that delivers self-optimized design, predictive operational intelligence and asset performance enhancement to operators and engineering service providers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It integrates with operational data through SCADA systems, historian software, sensor gateways, and enterprise asset management to trigger physics-constrained AI modeling.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<h4><b>What they wanted</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> from us-</strong> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry that propels industrial design and processes, Geminus wanted to develop a website that would portray their brand in the true sense and that is also coherent with their brand voice.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there was a need to create a dashboard that would run smoothly and support the inventory of inferred solutions and that would be integrated with their modeling platform on the website.</span>
<h4><b>What we offered </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After understanding the in-depth industry collateral, we devised a strategy of making a website that would communicate the nature of the company, showcasing the importance of the service being offered.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the user persona of the website, we created a coherent UI that would introduce them to the modeling platform.</span>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: How do you see digital marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?</b></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aayush: </strong>We are living in a moment when technology is helping us in bringing more and better audiences to like our products. So, in future brands will have to change the customer shopping experience by having more improved strategies for their customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the brands have to stay ahead of their competitors in the future digital marketing environment, then have to follow these key elements: <em>Enhancing voice search &amp; mobile, making the best use of AI technologies, remodeled UX experience and content diversification. </em></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These three trends will rule the digital marketing space in 2019 and ahead. Brands should start exploring and optimizing their content for voice search. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report by Google, 20 percent of all Google search queries will now take place through voice search. Not only this, marketing automation is predicted to undergo a radical change because of the confluence of technology and marketing.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Digiperform: According to you, what are the various ingredients for a successful digital marketer and business?</b></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aayush: </strong>The digital marketing industry growing at a fast pace and becoming incredibly competitive, it has become imperative to have that zeal to learn and to apply in everyday plans and strategies. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital industry requires passion and a desire to succeed, so hiring the right resources who have the eagerness to learn is one of the most important ingredients.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your strengths and focusing on the same helps in making an agency successful. Knowing the numbers is an essential ingredient that helps in giving an extreme amount of clarity around what one wants and what it’s going to take to get it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying Updated with the top of industry news will help in keeping the business on the top.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>&#8220;Blogging is not rocket science; it&#8217;s about being yourself and putting what you have into it. &#8220;</strong>
This is well accumulated by one the growing digital marketing bloggers of India &#8211; <strong>Deepak</strong>, who is a founder of the blogging site, <a href="https://digitechnolog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digiTechnolog.com</a>.
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Who is Deepak?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deepak is a multi-skilled guy who is a Blogger, Digital Marketer, and WordPress Expert. Even being a Mechanical Engineer by degree, he got fascinated with digital marketing so much that he decided to pursue his career as a Digital Marketing Blogger. Interesting, Right!</span>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://digiperform.com/digitalks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigiTalks By Digiperform</a>, we decided to have a chit chat over a cup of coffee and ask him about his blogging journey. And, especially, how he is making money out of it.</span></span></span>
<h4><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/digitalks-with-deepak-digitechnolog.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-22792 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/digitalks-with-deepak-digitechnolog.png" alt="digitalks with deepak digitechnolog" width="276" height="368" /></strong></span></a></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:- Hi Deepak! Briefly share about yourself, your hobbies, likes or dislikes, etc.</strong></span></h4>
<b>Deepak:-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hello Digiperform! First of all thanks a lot for giving me this opportunity.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I’ve always loved computers &amp; internet and wanted to become a programmer by pursuing a degree in Computer Science. But, somehow, I got into Mechanical Engineering. (Well, that&#8217;s another long story)</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in 2014, during my 1st year of engineering, I discovered the term “<strong>B<em>logging</em></strong>” and started collecting information about it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, now, after 5+ years, I’m completely into online marketing &#8211; blogging and some other kinds of digital marketing.</span>
Yes, you can clearly state me as an example who didn&#8217;t follow his career as per his degree.
Like, your campaign <em><strong>Skill Over Degree</strong></em>!
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I’m a workaholic person and love working on my websites. Most of the time you will find me with my laptop only. But, I do go out with my friends on weekends. Having fun is also very important. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During my early days, I had started many blogs, viral news sites and I was a part of the founding team of a rooms-for-rent searching startup called <strong>Hitbik</strong>, but nothing seemed to be working.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on, I got into affiliate marketing and earned my first few pennies promoting <a href="https://www.clickbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clickbank</a> products. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, that’s how I got into digital marketing and made my passion, my profession!</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:- Please tell us about DigiTechnolog. How it got started?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deepak:-</b> <a href="https://digitechnolog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digiTechnolog</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a digital marketing blog where I share my understanding and findings related to various parameters like SEO, affiliate marketing, productivity hacks, and some other technical things.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I mentioned earlier, before starting digiTechnolog, I had started my very first affiliate website promoting a Clickbank product. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, with almost zero knowledge of SEO, I was able to rank that website on the first page of Google. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The site made me my very first <strong>$500</strong> and, unfortunately, after 2 months, due to poor search engine optimization, the website got penalized.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, I decided to start a blog where I can share the real working ways of digital marketing, especially SEO, from my experience and help other people who are just getting started in the field as well.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, whatever I have learned in digital marketing, share on my blog digiTechnolog regularly.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:-  As you have shared Why you decided to start blogging, we would like to know the “Best Moment” in your blogging journey.</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deepak:-</b> To be honest, I have always been passionate about blogging.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to follow a famous <strong>Indian blogger Amit Agarwal</strong> and loved the way he used to share some really interesting and informative articles on his blog </span><a href="https://www.labnol.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labnol.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, blogging was just my passion back then, but now, it has become my profession. After 3 back-to-back unsuccessful blogs, I started digiTechnolog which is still in the initial phase, but it’s growing fast.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best moment in my blogging journey was when I earned my first $$$ online. It was a kind of motivation for me.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Digiperform:-  As a blogger, how do you see digital marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?</span></strong></h4>
<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:- </strong></span><i>Digital marketing evolves every day.</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we know, almost 50% of the world is not connected to the internet yet, so in the near future, digital marketing will keep maximizing its reach to the newly connected ones.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Big companies will focus on deep analytics and increased data mining (such as AI and Machine Learning) in order to serve relevant and personalized content to the users. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those days are almost gone when marketers used to send irrelevant emails in bulk and expect sales from that.</span>
<h4><b><i>Mobile-focused contents will rise.</i></b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive and engaging content will be preferred over the normal blog posts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video and audio content will attract more visitors and, in the few coming years, video contents will attract almost 80% of all web traffic. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the online companies have already started to shift towards video and podcasts kinds of digital marketing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to me, the top 3 trends that will prevail in the coming years are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Content Personalization</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one likes to go through the contents which are of no use or completely irrelevant to them. After a significant increase in data mining and deep analytics by online companies, consumers will get to see more personalized and highly relevant contents only.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers will even be able to customize the contents of their choice.</span>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Voice Search</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have seen the increasing trend of voice searches. According to a prediction, by the year 2020, 50% of all the searches will be conducted via voice search.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, creating voice search friendly contents should be on the priority list of digital marketers.</span>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Influencer Marketing</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers will trust other consumers more than brand advertisements and digital marketing campaigns will turn more like content-driven marketing campaigns.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-influencer-marketing-course-the-beginners-guide-to-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">influencer marketing</a> is nothing but the improved version of celebrity endorsement which will keep rising significantly in the coming years.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:-  Some people feel blogging can be a very boring career. How you would like to answer that? Is it boring or people are lazy to think like that?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deepak:-</b> <em>Blogging is boring; only if you are not passionate about it.</em></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes 1-2 years before a blog may start making some money. You will need to have a lot of patience. In my opinion, people should start blogging in the niche they already know well about, because that would need lesser research while writing articles and it won’t feel boring either.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, I mainly write about topics which I know well about. And, I really enjoy writing blog posts related to SEO, productivity hacks, etc.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digitechnolog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-22805 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-08-at-3.49.13-PM.png" alt="digiTechnolog" width="306" height="408" /></a>I always recommend beginners to start blogging part-time while pursuing a degree or doing a job, because in the first few years it would hardly get you any money. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, later, when you want to do it for full time, put all your efforts to grow that site.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:-  What are do’s and don’ts one should follow if someone is looking for Blogging as a career?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deepak:-</b> According to me, the following are the do’s and don’ts that everyone should follow while starting up with blogging.</span>
<b>Do’s</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, start your blog side-by-side with your college or job.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your blog with WordPress because it is easier to use and good for the SEO purpose.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog something you already know about.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write detailed articles and do proper research while writing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always try to use 5-10 images in your article.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link to external related sources which will make your content more credible.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<b>Don’ts</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t go for free domains or free hosting.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t keep your site’s design clustered. Keep it minimal and clean.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t make your blog a news site. Publish late but informative and detailed articles only.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t use random images from Google. Instead, use stock free images from Pixabay, Pexels, Unsplash, etc.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:-  You must be following blogs of influencers to keep you updated. Share which you admire the most?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deepak:-</b> Indeed!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I follow a lot of influencers and digital marketers to keep myself updated with the latest information related to the digital marketing space.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a huge fan of Brian Dean’s blog </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backlinko.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where he shares really high-quality articles and guides on various digital marketing related topics. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, I think every blogger and digital marketer should take inspiration from Brian Dean for the kind of quality contents that he creates.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian’s </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an amazing place to master SEO skills for beginners as well as experts.</span>

<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:-  You are experienced in blogging? Please share your experience of how a fresher can start his/her blogging career? And, what are the various ways to earn from blogging?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deepak:-</b> Blogging may seem like rocket science at first, but once you get into, it becomes easier.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, my advice to the freshers is that go ahead, set up a website and start writing. Don’t wait for the perfect time and don’t expect your first few articles to be perfect &#8211; let it as it is.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just write as you speak &#8211; in a conversational style, because blogging is all about the content you provide and remember </span><b>“<a href="https://digiperform.com/content-called-king-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content is the King</a>”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just make sure that your content is informative and provides a lot of value to the readers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, when it comes to earning money from blogging, below are the 3 best methods for beginners.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By affiliate promotion</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Adsense or other ads network</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By selling your own products</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the people who are just starting up, I recommend going with affiliate promotion over other methods of monetization.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can join various affiliate networks like <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Amazon Affiliate Program</strong></a> etc. depending upon your niche and topic of the contents of your blog. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can recommend related products which are relevant for your readers in between the blog posts. The main reason why I like earning by promoting affiliate products is that you don’t need to put a lot of effort into creating your own products. You just earn promoting famous and established products through your blog.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few affiliate networks even offer commissions of up to <strong>50%</strong>. So, if there is a lot of valuable traffic on your blog then you can earn a great amount of money.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Adsense program</a> or some other ads network can also make you money but not as much as the affiliate promotion.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting some experience, you can also create some paid and premium content like online courses, eBooks etc. for your readers. If your content is of high quality and provides a lot of value to the customers then just sit back and watch your blog making money.</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Digiperform:-  Any suggestion you would like to give to our readers and students who want to make a career as a blogger?</strong></span></h4>
<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deepak:- </strong></span><i>Blogging tests your patience and determination.</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Blogging is definitely not for the people who are looking to earn money online quickly. It may not make you money at first but blogging does teach you the way of life. Like earlier, successful people used to write diaries &#8211; blogging is nothing but an online diary.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing regularly can help you in</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving your writing skills,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving your present ability, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Improving your storytelling skills</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read other people’s blogs, stay updated, take inspiration from them and produce contents that your readers will love to read to.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, with that being said, the interview has come to an end, and hope I was able to put my thoughts impactfully.</span>
