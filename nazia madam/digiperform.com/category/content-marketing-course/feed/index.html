&nbsp;
<h2><b>What Is Content Marketing ROI?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content Marketing ROI is the success percentage of your content marketing strategies that states how much revenue you have gained from your marketing strategies in comparison to what you have spent. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many businesses, it is the major aspect to define their business success; however, money is not the ultimate metric to define your marketing success. For example, for many sites, the ROI can be in the form of a number of followers or for some it can be a number of ebook downloads. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Various metrics matter in your content marketing success. That is why it is important to understand which metric really matters to measure content marketing ROI.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we know, the purpose to generate various kind of content is to convert visitors into actual customers. The same can be encouraged by a <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-chapter-2-how-content-marketing-relates-to-marketing-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing funnel</a> which is a system that helps to convert as many leads into customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As content marketing has many non-monetary benefits that can prove your content is actually working; like </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building brand awareness</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building trust</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing engagement</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building relationships</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving visibility in search engines</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building and improving customer loyalty</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a thought leader in your industry</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring content marketing ROI is a difficult challenge to cater because of these non-tangible factors. But there are many ways to measure these metrics as well. The fact is that no one won’t invest in content marketing if it’s not result oriented or not generating positive results for the business. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>So, how do you measure content marketing ROI? </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the most common content marketing metrics that you can use to measure your success:</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Brand Awareness</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the stats, 74% of CEOs say maintaining and increasing brand awareness is always a top priority for them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder, the first goal of any <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-chapter-3-how-to-build-a-refined-content-marketing-strategy-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content marketing strategy</a> is to increase brand awareness. However, it&#8217;s difficult to prove its worth to return on investment (ROI).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although tough to measure and tie directly to revenue, you can track your progress by looking at:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social shares and following</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog views</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct website traffic</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning website visitors</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Views and shares from partnership audiences</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Audience Engagement</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you accomplish building brand awareness, the next step you make to engage your audience with informational as well as problem-solving content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While brand awareness helps you to make your audience aware of your brand and get familiar with your product &amp; services; it also helps them to understand your brand better.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever your audience engages, you can make analysis of what they like or what they don’t; their biggest challenges and what they want to know from you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to find out like:  </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media shares, likes, and comments</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comments on blogs</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA (click-through rates)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing page conversion rates</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heat maps and clicks patterns</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website bounce rate</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time spent on page</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website page views</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Drive Website Traffic</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building brand awareness and maintaining audience engagement are a long-time process that simultaneously goes along with website traffic. Great content &#8211; engaging content definitely drive traffic to your posts or website and build your brand image. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In content marketing goals, increasing website traffic is more focused on pushing traffic into the top level of the marketing funnel that ultimately helps to restore the ROI. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To see whether your content is effective at driving traffic to your website, look at the following metrics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique visits (overview and breakdown by channel)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onsite engagement (bounce rate, time on page)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword rankings</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New vs. returning visitors</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing blog traffic is another content marketing goal which is part of gaining web traffic. To track the progress toward this goal, all you need is to measure:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog visits per month</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword rankings</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social shares</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New vs. returning visitors</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engagement metrics (bounce rate, time on page)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA (click-through rates)</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Lead Generation</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 85% of the marketers around the world believe that lead generation is the ultimate goal for any business success to measure ROI. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder, they try their heart and soul to convert their audience and generate the lead accordingly. To measure how well your content is working for lead generation, you’ll want to track these metrics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA (click-through rates)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing page conversion rates</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversion rates of leads to customers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leads generated per month</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Search Engine Visibility</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we already have read before in beginner’s guide to content marketing, SEO plays a big role in generating the right traffic for your website. Getting your content rank on top of the first page Google search engine is always a dream goal for any content marketer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To track your content progress as per SEO strategy, be sure to look at your keyword rankings at least once per quarter, but we suggest pulling reports once per month. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other metrics that you need to track along with SEO:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website traffic from organic search</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique website visits</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Topic clusters</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the same, you can use various SEO tools and generate your content according to the latest <a href="https://digiperform.com/google-seo-updates-the-past-present-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google SEO updates</a>.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Sales</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, fighting for all the great marketing goals and tracking them each month or quarterly; few marketers/businessmen understand the language of Sales only. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing is a valuable tool for moving leads through the inbound marketing funnel and turning visitors into leads and leads into customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To track your success in using the content for sales, monitor these metrics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead to customer conversion rate (overall and by content piece)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales conversion rates</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length of your sales cycle</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contract size</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost per lead</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Retention and Upsells</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, retaining your audience and upselling them again. This is the most difficult but mandatory goal of content marketing to improve retention and driving upsell. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But creating for your personas shouldn’t end just because someone becomes a customer. Instead, now is the time for you to delight your customers and make them a “</span><b>Happy Customer Forever</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your customer is happy with your product or services, there are 100 percent chances he/she would recommend your business to other people. This is the time when we can’t ignore our happy customers. They are likely to trust you, would love to make more purchases and drive more revenue through upsells. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few metrics to track toward this goal:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer retention rate</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percentage of repeat customers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue from upsells</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Is there any formula to calculate content marketing ROI?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take a simple calculative way to measure the content marketing ROI from <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convince and Convert</a>:</span>
<span style="color: #993300;"><b><i>“Return minus investment, divided by investment, expressed as a percentage”.</i></b></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example,</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone has spent $500 on creating a piece of content, and receiving leads worth $2000, then your ROI is 300%:</span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$2000-$500 = $1500</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1500/$500 = 3</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">3 x 100% = 300%</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Conclusion:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it’s difficult to show how content marketing is performing and generate ROI, these metrics can give you a better sense of performance and how your content is helping with the goals.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By putting the right content with the right tactics, you will be able to generate more traffic, lead and sales to please your businesses or bosses. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, content marketing is worth an investment.</span>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost motive of any content marketing strategy is to captivate the target audience, educate them and convert them into customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, no wonder, all the content creators give their heart and soul to create such kind of unique and valuable content that definitely helps businesses to achieve their end goals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kudos to all the content creators!</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, who has less idea what is content marketing all about, we are here to help. </span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free beginner’s guide to content marketing</a>, we have been sharing basic elements related to content marketing, especially for beginners. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, we have shared:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How content marketing plays an important role in a business success? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various ways to create a content marketing strategy? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is content marketing related to marketing funnel? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to identify your audience for content marketing strategy? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various tools that can help you generate effective content for the same?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all these efforts won’t give desired results if none of these have appropriate Call-to-Action (CTA) triggers. Yes, you have read right!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, if your motive to share the content is to bring visitors to the website, then you will use a trigger (CTA) to land your audience to your websites. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Same way, whenever you receive an email stating any shopping sale, you might have noticed </span><b>Call-to-Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing to the website or app. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These action buttons help target audience to land upon the right designated path and give you the successful campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this chapter of beginner’s guide to content marketing, we will be sharing how Call-to-Actions play an important role in any content marketing success. What are the basic steps you need to keep in mind while creating the content? How to create a compelling call-to-action for your content marketing strategy?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-19066 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/call-to-actions.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="254" /></span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have stated earlier, Call-to-action helps to captivate the target audience as well as increase the conversions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not all the call-to-action can give you the success rate.  Most of the content marketers aren’t using effective CTAs to target the ideal audience and convert them as happy customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look into business website stats, only 30% of businesses are using appropriate CTAs to engage their ideal customers. Rest, 70% of business sites lack call-to-action. This is devastating. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our content creators aka marketers need to understand the importance of CTAs in their marketing strategy and how they (CTAs) help them to increase their open as well as success rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging a prospect to take desired actions as per your marketing strategy may seem the hardest task for marketers, but is not unachievable. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to create informative content for your readers that can solve their problems and serve your purpose. You need to focus on creating a beautiful attractive content design and more &amp; more powerful as well as compelling Call-to-Action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers look for easy and understandable </span><b>Clickable Button</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than a confusing action. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are CTAs?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call-to-Action</a> which are the clickable buttons basically used on your website, landing pages, emails, blogs, etc to guide your readers or visitors towards your goal conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the part of your content that the user needs to click in order to take the action you want them to take.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the question comes, why marketers fail to convert readers to customers. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does wrong in creating a compelling call to action? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What goes into a strong CTA? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the basic things you need to keep in mind while creating an effective CTA for your marketing strategy?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s read further: </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Choose a Goal:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, decide why you need to CTA and what are your purpose to use the following CTA? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should your call to action button is to generate webinar sign-ups or you want your readers to download the ebook? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your audience to share your content or want to land up to your website? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason can be any…..</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, decide your goal and write your appropriate CTA based on your content strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, of course, use the desired actionable link so that the reader can the desired action with minimal hassle.</span>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Consider the Context:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the place of your reader or prospect in the current marketing cycle. Does your reader knows about your product already or it’s the first time that you have introduced your services to them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it won’t make a sense if your reader is landing for the first time on your homepage to get a CTA about buying an expensive product. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, understand the level and accordingly set your CTA. For example, if you are selling some audio product, in such case, use CTA as “Request a Demo” or “Learn More” instead of using “Buy Now”.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-19070 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/calltoaction-example.png" alt="" width="575" height="362" />
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Make to Short &amp; Precise:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember on the golden rule of using CTAs. Using multiple calls to actions buttons in one piece of content can ruin the whole information, lower your conversion rate and confuse your readers as well. Also, wordy CTAs can get easily ignored. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use short and precise CTAs to make your content more effective. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days our readers are more knowledgeable and understand that a hyperlink or button is intended to click. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, Instead of guiding them saying “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here to register for our free webinar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”; use or state “</span><b><i>Register for our free webinar</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which is likely to have a stronger impact.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Place CTA Strategically:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While creating valuable content, the marketer should know where to place the CTA in the content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always recommended not to use CTA in the middle of your content, that probably will confuse your readers and distract them from your valuable content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always place a call to action at the end of the content body when the message of your content is delivered. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2></h2>
<h1><b>How to create a compelling call to action?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content creators invest a lot of time in generating problem-solving content for their readers or give ultimate efforts into your online marketing strategy, but they forget to give focus on research of appropriate Call-to-Actions which led to less conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are getting traffic on your content but no conversions, then this is the high time to look into your “How to club perfect CTA in the content” strategy. </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are few tips to create a compelling call to action for your content.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Direct</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop looking for indirect ways to convert your audience. State clearly what is the purpose of sharing the content. Stop beating around the bush.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your content / your website / your business is valuable that should be in direct in approach. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be precise and tell your visitors what you do and what exactly you would like them to do.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Call to Action must be simple, short and strong.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure there is no room to play guessing games for your visitors or readers to get confused or clueless. Use straightforward examples in a positive way like ‘get started,’ ‘sign up,’ ‘submit,’ or ‘download’.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Unique</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a marketer, you already aware how it is crucial to be unique and stand different in the crowd if you want to beat the competition. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find something that makes your call-to-action special; it could be ridiculously simple or something that aggravates a problem.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Use Actionable Language</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use action words that compel or motivate your visitors to do what you want them to. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, “</span><b><i>Call us today for a free sample</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” will make them curious to have or try at least Free sample which seems a good call to take an action. You are giving clear direction to the reader using the action-  “Call”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other ways, you can say like “Give us a call for a free demo”  but it seems less actionable then previous one. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Urgent</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CTAs you use in your content must create the urgency so that visitors take the action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The agenda is to convey the message that your readers are missing out the great opportunity that should be theirs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like one example we have used earlier. “Call us today for a free sample” denoted more urgency instead of “Give us a call for a free demo”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Call us today create the urgency that they can miss out the great deal to use the free sample or demo than later one stating or requesting to give a call for the free demo. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both have a slight difference but the way you approach matter a lot in your CTAs. While “today” is a good word to add in your call to action, using “now” or “immediately” is even better. These words imply a greater urgency and also make it clear that the offer may not last forever.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Call-to-Action Example</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Netflix</b></span></h2>
<b>CTA Button: Join Free for a Month</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19065 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-15-at-11.09.56-PM.png" alt="" width="555" height="347" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever a new user feels to sign up any new program, he/she fears to commit as it will be the pain to cancel their subscription if they end up not liking it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix has been running various campaigns stating not to fear to cancel the subscription by saying “Cancel Anytime” along with “Join Free for a Month&#8221; CTA with full assurance. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This assurance alone has boosted unlimited sign-ups where you notice that the red color of the primary and secondary CTAs here match Netflix&#8217;s logo color.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bravo!</span>
&nbsp;
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an effective call-to-action takes creativity, time, practice and lots of research.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that it needs to be simple enough so that users can easily understand your message.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the content and CTA should be compelling enough to persuade them to do what you want them to do.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, don’t feel afraid to be experimental and see what works best for your audience.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are a marketer or entrepreneur, you should know these basics if you want your business at top notch. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a content creator,  you may think or likely convinced that you know about your target audience inside and out. However, how often as a marketer you thought and do your data based audience research? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the answer is “</span><b><i>rarely</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “</span><b><i>no</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, that you need to deeply figure out how deeply you can work it out to club this as the “must to-do-task” into your to-do list to determine the cross-channel audience. This will not only nurture your knowledge while creating content, but it will also help you to make content marketing efforts successful. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Things To Keep In Mind While Identifying Your Audience</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Social Media, Audiences and Content Marketing &#8211; All are connected</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create </span><b>content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the help of content marketing tools, you share your content through </span><b>social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach out maximum active </span><b>audiences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These three (highlighted ones) are immensely connected with each other and quite dependent on each other as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you publish your content on blogs or create audios/videos, you need the distribution of the same content through multiple platforms to get deserved recognition. </span>

<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What is Marketing Sales Funnel?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing sales funnel commonly known as </span><b>Sales Funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>Revenue Funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consists of the following stages:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awareness</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decision</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Brand awareness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feeds the top of the funnel through various mediums like TV, newspapers, word to mouth, pamphlets, radios, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You let your audience/people moving through the funnel by getting them </span><b>interested</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through awareness. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you make them interested, they make a </span><b>decision</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and takes the </span><b>Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/marketing-funnels.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18841 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/marketing-funnels.png" alt="" width="453" height="453" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A funnel that has a low conversion rate which is why it is called a “</span><b>leaky funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Where the leak takes place in those four stages tells marketers or businessmen to what layer of the funnel needs work on. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big problem with the traditional sales funnel is that it really doesn’t address how modern consumers and make them buy.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, when it comes to content marketing funnel, the marketers or companies don’t know how to create content? How content marketing, as well as companies, can come together and work like one? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers ask questions like:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many blog posts should I write?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How often should I be tweeting every day?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a specific percentage of my budget that I should be spending on video?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I really need to write white papers and ebooks?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">So, what is Content Marketing Funnel?</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose to generate various kind of content is to convert visitors into actual customers. The same been is encouraged by a content marketing funnel which is a system that helps to convert as many leads into customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through step by step content flow, the marketer can gain as many as potential customers to pay for your products or services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales funnel has a major flaw that there are chances people are your leads or potential customers, however, there are fewer chances they would actually buy your product due to leakage. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The leakage is there are chances that as potential customers move through the funnel towards the much narrower neck (as mentioned in the picture), many will drop off.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome this leakage, the content marketing funnel has made a little variation in the actual sales marketing funnel. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Its basic agenda is to make sure the smaller number of leads will actually make it through the entire funnel and become paying customers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A content marketing funnel has three broad stages:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Awareness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – when a lead or visitor first discovers your brand </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Evaluation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – when a qualified lead (or potential customer) decides to find out whether your product or service is the right fit or not</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Purchase</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – this is the stage every business desperately wants to achieve when the prospect gathers the last bit of information they need before deciding to buy and becomes a customer.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there should be another stage that every marketer or business should dare to achieve which can be clubbed as the fourth stage in the funnel i.e., </span><b>Happy Customers.</b>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18840 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Happy Customers</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses consider sales/conversion as the last stage of marketing funnel which is absolutely wrong. </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales may seem the ultimate goal but the strong and happy customer relationship is the foundation of any business. </span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the marketer should believe in this stage of the funnel and put more focus on Happy Customers than awareness and consideration. They will directly go to conversion especially when it comes to small businesses.  </span>
<h4><em><strong>Don’t agree, let’s take a look:</strong></em></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In your marketing plans, you have only or around 5% chance to sell your product or services to a new customer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you have an existing happy customer, there are 60-70% chance to sell the same product or services to a repeat customer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree every business needs to work on to get new customers. However, your marketing strategy should be designed in such a way where you can target your new audience as well remarket your happy customers again.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been stated that 65% or more of a small business’ revenues come in through existing customers. You agree or not, a little 5% reduction in customer defection can increase revenues by 100%.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketers as well businesses need to work on strategies where they can target to retain their old customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, only 32% of companies are trying to retain their customer. Rest yet need to focus on that. Competition is serious. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What type of Content Goes with Content Marketing Funnel?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the real question arises: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of content belongs at which stage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the answer to your query in a simple way. We have shared different examples to signify which type of content belongs to which stage. Have a look!</span>
<h4><b>Awareness</b></h4>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads</span></li>
