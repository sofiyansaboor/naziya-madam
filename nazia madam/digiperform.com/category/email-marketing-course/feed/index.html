										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Hello Readers!</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the last chapter of our <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-email-marketing-course-beginners-guide-to-email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free email marketing course</a> where we will be sharing the common set of email marketing questions asked by the marketers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions can be your doubts or questions asked during your interview to test your knowledge. In either way, this chapter will be helpful to you to understand the concept.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>
<img class="wp-image-18310 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/question-mark-370x350.png" alt="" width="225" height="213" />
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What’s the point of email marketing (In short, what is email marketing)?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing is the effective medium of online marketing to reach out to people at once in order to encourage them to do business with you. The business can be in any form; like purchasing your product or service, download the ebook, visiting your blogs/website, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The end goal of any email marketing strategy leads to sales, conversion, web traffic, etc executed in a way that leads their subscribers to willingly complete the desired action. This approach builds audience trust through emails that are valuable and entertaining for the reader, thus increasing the sender’s credibility and getting that sender closer to their desired goal.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read More…&#8230;</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: How do I grow my email subscriber list?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing strategy is nothing if you don’t have a good email list or mailing list. An email marketing list is a list of subscribers/customers who are a part of periodic mailing distribution by the businesses. Your email list should include past, current and potential customers, friends, family and past coworkers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not easy to create valid and responsive mailing list just like that. It requires regular efforts and marketing strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to build an email marketing list from scratch?</span>

<a class="btn btn-default" title="Read More" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32028/25-clever-ways-to-grow-your-email-marketing-list.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More</a>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: How do I figure out what to write about?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good content is the sword of any marketing strategy. If you are not writing as per your audience interest, you will lose your chance to gain subscribers as well as potential buyers. The email should contain the valid information about your product or services but in a short &amp; crisp way. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be tied to the short subject line that contains the agenda of your email. Find out what your readers are looking for, learn about their habits &#8211; hobbies &#8211; patterns and try to provide them the resolution for the same. There are many email marketing analytics tools that can help you to understand the behavior pattern of your subscribers/visitors. Make sure that what you write is serving their interests, not your own agenda.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What are the best practices for email subject lines?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email subject lines play a major role in deciding whether the email will get clicked or not. You get only 3-4 seconds before your reader decides to open the email or not. Best practice is to personalize your subject line and share what is the email all about. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, 30-50 characters are considered as good and safe to follow. However, people have seen great success with subject lines over 70 characters and less than 49, so feel free to experiment. All you should follow to design short, specific and compelling subject lines. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For an example, you can read <a href="https://digiperform.com/15-amazing-email-subject-lines-youll-probably-want-to-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 Amazing Email Subject Lines You’ll Probably Want To Click</a></span>
<a class="btn btn-default" title="Subject Lines" href="https://digiperform.com/15-amazing-email-subject-lines-youll-probably-want-to-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subject Lines</a>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Q: Where does an email newsletter fit into email marketing?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The newsletter is one of the types of emails which is usually an email on one topic promoting a piece of content, products or services. Email newsletters may also feature ads or special offers, but they&#8217;re usually not prominently featured.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A generic email of your email campaign can eve be considered as a newsletter. Most people think they need an email newsletter, but often your email marketing program will be more effective for building your business if you send really specific content tailored to your marketing strategy. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What are the laws of email marketing?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An email marketing law such as CAN-SPAM never approves phishing as well as the purchased mailing list. Any ideal marketer is never approved of buying lists because there are laws in place to protect people from receiving certain types of unsolicited communications. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Readout complete guide to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laws of email marketing</a>.</span>

<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What’s the best time and day to send emails?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most debatable question of all times &#8211; When to send emails? Ask as many people you can, you will get different answers. Even many trusted brands and resources have different opinions like:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kissmetrics says early mornings and weekends … but also says those days/times are also the most likely to get you unsubscribes and bounces.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Experian’s benchmark study says that 8 p.m. to midnight is optimal.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wordstream thinks that Thursday from 8-9 a.m. is best.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">MailChimp says that Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. are the surefire winners.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: Email deliverability and email open rates: what do these mean?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are two important email marketing metrics that decide the success of your email marketing campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email deliverability rate is the success rate of your email marketing campaign where getting an email delivered to a person’s email address is measured. For same, all you need is to take the number of emails delivered and divide it by the number that was sent.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, an email open rate is the percentage emails opened that have ended up in the inboxes. These metrics have an important impact on how your email marketing campaign performs. If someone doesn’t open your email, they never even have the chance to engage with your content.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What’s a good email open rate?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no definite answer to this question. Every business or campaign has their own requirements. Statistically speaking, Silverpop’s email benchmark study revealed that across 3,000 companies in 40 different countries, the average open rate was 20.2 percent. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically if you’re getting 15-25 percent email open rates, you’re up to industry standards. Over 30 percent and you’re nailing it.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What other metrics should you track for email marketing?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from email deliverability and open rate, there are many other metrics that marketer should measure for larger goals whether its B2B or B2C campaign.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are four other foundational metrics that you should measure in order to get high email deliverability:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Inbox Rates:</strong> which determines how many delivered emails actually made it into someone’s inbox (rather than their junk folder).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bounce Rates:</strong> It is the percentage of emails that were rejected by recipients’ mail servers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Spam Reports:</strong> It depicts how many times your emails were marked as junk mail/spam by recipients.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Unsubscribes:</strong> states how many people unsubscribed from your emails.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What are the best ways to encourage opt-in?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I recommend brainstorming alternative techniques for capturing email addresses. Map out all the opportunities available for capturing a buyer’s information between your different channels and audience segments (shown in the matrix below) and use this to generate new ideas. Take a look at what you and competitors are currently doing and then do a ‘gap analysis’ to select options you aren’t currently using.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">￼</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: Should I be using pop-ups? What about the quality of the people from pop-ups?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop-ups are increasingly being used in many industry sectors, particularly retail, publishing, and travel. This is because, when well-defined and tested, they will almost always give you significantly more new contacts in your database. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use pop-ups to boost your subscriber numbers, it’s inevitable that there may be some decline in quality as not every subscriber is ready to allow and make changes in their settings. Some subscribers are not even aware of the benefits as well.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain the quality, it’s important to be able to profile visitors efficiently. Also, follow the best practices to be sensitive to the user experience and don’t display a pop-up too quickly. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: How much do I need to profile subscribers?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking too much information can be turned off for subscribers. Try to ask the limited but important question to subscribers that are important for enabling your business to send more relevant emails. For example, in Digiperform, we ask Name, Contact Number, Email, and City, so that we can discuss the course as per the location and send the necessary details as well.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: Where can I begin to improve email targeting?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you need to begin with these basic techniques to achieve the best results from your email marketing campaign:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try A/B testing, also known as Split testing, where you create two version of your campaign with slight changes and record the success rate. Learn more about A/B testing &#8211; <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-email-marketing-course-how-to-use-a-b-tests-to-improve-your-email-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to use A/B tests to improve your email campaigns</a>?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating two (or more) alternative versions of your standard newsletter. For example, if you are a lifestyle writer, then you can create the separate newsletter for men clothing and women clothing. And, then send according to gender segmented list.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changing your welcome email content to be relevant for different audience segments.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending post-purchase emails to promote similar products or related products in different categories (cross-sell and upsell).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also manage these things with automation where you can send Welcome or Thank you emails whenever any subscribers start following your services. Automation is very quick and efficient way to handle your email marketing campaigns.</span>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #993300;"><strong>Q: Should I buy a list just to kick off my email marketing?</strong> </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is Big <strong>NO</strong>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should never be buying lists. This is totally against Email Marketing Laws. Even you will buy these subscribers list and people opted into those lists, they didn&#8217;t opt in to hear from you. This means when they get an email from you, they&#8217;ll not just be less likely to open or click on it because they don&#8217;t know you. Then you will be marked as <strong>SPAM</strong>.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also be mucking up your deliverability score by buying lists, which will affect the success of your email marketing long term. And these are just a few of the dangers of buying a list.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: How do I make sure I don&#8217;t land in the spam folder?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing you can do to stay out of the spam folder is not to buy subscribers’ list. Earn the genuine subscribers with your efforts. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also follow best practices like identifying who you are in your sender name, making unsubscription easy, segmenting your lists and tailoring your content to those segments, cleansing your lists, and not bombarding your recipients&#8217; inboxes with too much email.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: What&#8217;s the difference between a hard and a soft bounce?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When an email bounces, it means that your email couldn’t deliver in recipient&#8217;s email address. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A hard bounce means that it is failed to deliver due to major reasons such as fake, blocked or invalid email address. Whereas, in soft bounce, the email is failed to deliver to temporary issues such as a full mailbox or an unavailable service.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep your list healthy, make sure you&#8217;re removing all hard bounces and keeping an eye on the soft bounce addresses. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By not cleansing your list, you may end up hurting your other emails&#8217; deliverability. </span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Q: How do I prevent people from unsubscribing from my emails?</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&#8217;t want to break the law, you should never prevent someone from unsubscribing from your emails. CAN-SPAM, one of the most important laws you need to follow as a marketer, says that email marketers should always make it easy for people to unsubscribe from their emails by providing a clearly visible link in every email message and honoring those unsubscribes in a timely manner.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the list of few questions that can help you to understand the process. Let us know in the comment section if you have any question related to email marketing campaigns. We will definitely try our best to answer them. </span>

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>How to design an email for mobile devices?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few basic rules that you need to follow while making an email for mobile devices. Researches have confirmed that the number of people reading emails on mobile devices is growing more than the number of people reading emails on desktops. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, there are a set of rules that any marketer or businessman should follow to bring out the best emails for mobile devices. </span>
<h2><b>Rules to follow</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep the text content as simple and short to the point. People don’t like to spend much time reading emails. Most of them will just scan the message looking for something interesting or worthwhile so limit your text content to things that will hold attention.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use subtitles and a single-column layout.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget to include prominent call-to-action buttons. These buttons will help you to turn your subscribers into the lead to conversion no matter what platform they use to access your emails.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note to Remember:  Anyone reading your email is using a significantly smaller screen than those using a laptop. Therefore, it’s important to structure your message to be easily understood.</span>
<h2><b>Typical characteristics for messages designed for mobile devices</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Large font sizes</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good size for section titles is 30px but 22px is an absolute minimum. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text in the body of the message should use at least 14px.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single-column format</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-column designs of not more than 520px work best for mobile devices. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are easier to read for subscribers and less likely encounter display problems.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>A minimum clickable area of 44px x 44px</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major part to Remember is that mobile users don’t have a mouse to help them click on things. They just have their finger to interact with your message. And, the finger needs a certain amount of space to click on anything. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommended size for such an area is 44px x 44px but it could be as small as 44px high by 29px wide. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget that an empty space of at least 10px should surround clickable icons to make them stand out.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Clearly visible clickable elements</b></h2>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/493_big.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18046 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/493_big.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="437" /></a>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clickable icons such as Call to Actions; should be graphically prepared, placed on solid color backgrounds and be labeled with proper action like “Buy Now”, “Read More”, &#8220;Shop Now&#8221;, etc. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it easy for readers to understand and navigate your email since they don’t have a mouse to tell them if a call to action is clickable or not.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Pay attention to your pre-header text</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first focus goes to the header of your emails. First, it is necessary to contain the motto of your email in the heading itself. Secondly, try to keep it short and crispy. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-header text, meanwhile, is often overlooked though equally important! </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, do not forget to personalize the heading as well. Personalization is critical to the success of email marketing.  An ideal marketer should be encouraged to implement it within their email.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Use a responsive template</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18234 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mobileem.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="393" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re using a pre-designed template from your email service provider or email marketing tool, make sure it&#8217;s responsive. You will find the number of mobile responsive email templates that are designed to automatically fit the screen on which they&#8217;re being viewed. By using these mobile responsive templates, your email will look the way it should whether on a smartphone, tablet, or a PC. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the end of chapter 10 where you have learned the few tactics to optimize your emails for mobile devices. For beginners, we would suggest you use mobile responsive pre-designed templates. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next chapter of email marketing course, we will be sharing the list of email marketing terminology that will help you to keep the email marketing knowledge on your toes. </span>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever we talk about Automation, the first picture came in our mind is robots, machines, etc. In other words, pretty much opposite to human. </span>
<h2><b>So, what is Email Marketing Automation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of email marketing, automation is the ability to send and reply to emails automatically.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a> is the ability to send or reply triggered emails to subscribers with relevant information as per your email campaign. It can be used for the variety of marketing campaigns, for example, welcome emails, End Of Season emails, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.freshworks.com/marketing-automation/email-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Email Marketing</a> technology helps to nurture more leads and add a personal touch by sending birthday greetings on time, or automated blog updates, etc. Email automation helps to make your email marketing campaign more personalized and efficient in every way.</span>
<h2><b>How Does Email Marketing Automation Work?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email Marketing Automation can help marketers as well as businessmen to create email workflows that automatically emails to subscribers once a certain trigger has been activated. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of triggers for a <strong>B2B</strong> company are …</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a website visitor views a landing page but doesn’t submit the form</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a lead has downloaded several pieces of content but has not contacted the business directly</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a potential client has started following the company’s social media accounts</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a <strong>B2C</strong> brand, triggers might be …</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a website visitor has viewed several items but not added any to their cart</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a consumer has placed items in their shopping cart but not purchased</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a consumer makes a purchase</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing automation just not only for prospective customers, but it can also help brands to retain their old customers as well. You can share new product launches as well as reminders emails to your existing as well as new prospects through the automated email marketing campaign. </span>

<strong>There also are a few workflows that work well for both B2B and B2C businesses. Here are some examples:</strong>
<h2><b>Automated Welcome Emails: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever a new customer or subscriber joins your newsletter or visits your website, you can send welcome emails through automated email campaigns welcoming your clients and stating about the company as well as services. It gives a great impression when you send beautiful emails just after subscribers show interest in your brand. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/target-welcome-email.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18115 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/target-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" width="372" height="521" /></a>
<h2><b>Feedback Request Emails: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With an automated email marketing campaign, you can send feedback emails asking for the product feedback they have recently used, the working of the new app, how was the shopping experience and more. The feedback request email can be both positive as well as negative based on the kind of feedback you ask.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.31.08-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18189 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.31.08-PM.png" alt="" width="440" height="461" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While your messaging will be different depending on which behavior triggered the feedback request, these emails are extremely valuable as they show your subscribers you care about your opinion and also give you the chance to see where you can improve.</span>
<h2><b>Re-engagement Emails:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of emails help to reconnect with your existing clients or subscribers who haven’t shown any interest in some days. You can reschedule your emails (let’s say 90 days) to send your emails stating new discounts, the launch of products or blog updates etc to maintain the relationship with your prospects.</span>

<h2><b>Thank you Emails:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending an order confirmation and shipping information is a must when someone has completed a purchase. Adding a thank you message to a fulfillment email is a great way to improve your customer experience and build a good impression. They are also a smart way to combat any potential buyer’s remorse, reassuring customers they made a wise choice.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.33.21-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18191 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.33.21-PM.png" alt="" width="365" height="402" /></a>
<h2><b>Sale Countdown Emails: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sale countdowns are the perfect email automation to create a sense of anticipation or urgency around your sale. You could count down to when the sale begins. Or, once the sale is on, count down the hours, minutes, and seconds left until customers miss out. Countdown timers are a visually engaging element to add to these emails that are sure to grab your customer’s attention.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.35.55-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18192 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-2.35.55-PM.png" alt="" width="611" height="439" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost any action an individual takes when engaging with your brand can be tracked and utilized.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Why Should a marketer Use Email Marketing Automation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are five primary reasons every email marketer should use email marketing automation:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create highly segmented email lists that are automatically updated based on user data</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More quickly convert potential customers into actual customers</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More easily continue engaging with potential and existing customers</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Increase efficiency by automating the repetitive tasks associated with customer relationship management</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Improve engagement by delivering subscribers more relevant, personalized and timely messages</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some brands hesitate to use an automated form of an email campaign as they believe to give a personal touch to each and every email. Or, they may lack knowledge about automation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reality, automation makes it easier for you to keep track of your customers&#8217; activity. It gives more personalization to your email marketing campaigns and it&#8217;s more effective for the long run as well.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Why is an automated email marketing campaign important for any business?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some great pointers for automating your email campaigns:</span>
<h2><b>Show personal care to your audience</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best point of email marketing automation is that it gives the 24X7 advantage to stay in touch with your clients without any burden of manpower. As per campaign protocol, you can send relevant emails/replies on time. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a subscriber has just joined for free services to have a free trial test of your product. With your regular updates and assistance, your same free subscriber can turn into paying customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Same in the case of e-commerce, if one has landed upon your website and joined your email newsletter. Your regular updates regarding sales or discounts can turn the same customer into paying one. As the sales and discounted emails will interest him/her and lead to purchase any item as well. </span>
<h2><b>Save Time</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t like to save time? When it comes to business emails, it&#8217;s not easy to update or rewrite each email and send it to the subscriber. if you feel like to do so, you may need the hell of manpower to complete just messages and replies. Automation helps to save your time in this case. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than wasting time replying to each mail, it&#8217;s important to utilize the same time to design content for your upcoming email campaign or creating more email marketing strategies for your business. After you build the automation it unfolds by itself and you can spend your time on other things. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is monitor your campaigns time after time, analyze reports and review the emails that are not bringing the desired results. Don’t forget to optimize your campaigns by A/B testing.</span>
<h2><b>Grow Your Revenue Faster</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you plan your email marketing strategy with automation, you can expect tremendous results in terms of revenue as well. Because when you will be seriously sending emails to your customers/subscribers, there will be high chances to increase your click as well as open rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By tracking your click-open through rates and other actions, marketers can analyze which are the most interesting campaigns so far and how much they have generated leads or sales. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquiring a new lead is more expensive than generating on your own. Also, with automation, you can encourage your existing customers to shop more. It is no surprise that most marketers are interested in upselling. This will get easier to do with a behavior-based automation series (history) which will suggest your existing, as well as new customers, buy more products.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you may have seen how big e-commerce companies like eBay and Amazon are doing this by sending you similar products to the ones you already purchased. This is a great example of automation that is determined by the customer’s purchase history.</span>
<h2><b>Organize Your Campaigns</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal way to start any content-centric campaign is by creating an email marketing calendar. With the organized calendar, you will be more sorted and can look your campaign at a bigger picture. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation is a great help for any planning enthusiast because it lets you stick to the plan even when you are busy doing other things. Just prepare and schedule the content and the campaign will work itself out.</span>
<h2><b>Maintain Brand Personality</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing helps in maintaining the channel of communication between the brand and its customers. With automation, these possibilities increase ten folds. Automation helps to draft better emails and act as a voice for your brand. It conveys a better message to the prospects and reinforces the brands’ values. </span>
<h2><b>Measure Your Email Marketing Campaigns’ Results</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a general email marketing campaign, automation also helps to have an overview of how many emails are opened? Which emails generated more leads? Which parts of the campaign can be improved through A/B testing? Etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing tools allow you to monitor who is opening what, how many emails are bounced, and track all email activity for Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have integrated your campaign with Google Analytics, you can analyze your data and see automatically where the leads come from, how they converted, etc.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your email marketing campaign analytics can teach you about your subscribers’ behavior by showing the content they are most interested in. In other words, analytics let you evaluate what content attracts people to your products or services, which converts them to leads, and what convinces them to buy. Evaluate your marketing performance, adjust your future initiatives and reach your goals in a more cost-effective and time-saving way!</span>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18118 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/conversions-1.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="209" /></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing is one of the incredible methods to nurture prospective buyers and generate sales even in this current competition. All you need to is think and show &#8211; What makes you different? What makes you best out of all? What kind of marketing strategy are you should follow for your business to generate leads and increase conversions? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email Marketing is an art to create a compelling and eye-catching marketing strategy. However, if it’s designed in a right way, it can turn into the sale or the trash-can.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sure your every campaign bring out the best conversion rate for your business, we are sharing few email marketing practices suggested by email marketers that can make email campaigns fantastic, effective and increase conversion rates: </span>
<h2><b>A Captivating Title </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The title (subject line) is the primary thing anyone would notice and it&#8217;s reasonable the central factor regardless of whether you open an email or not. In order to increase your email marketing conversion rate, make sure your subject line that your email is all about. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you are sending a sales email to your subscribers, your email should incorporate &#8216;</span><b><i>20% Off on Next Order</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;. And, It will sound better than just stating ‘</span><b><i>Discount on Next Order</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/purity_cart_abandon_5uhp5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18113 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/purity_cart_abandon_5uhp5.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="534" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The subject line of the email marketing campaign should be appropriate (specific) and straightforward that gives more data.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the same subject line should be mentioned in your body of your email campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider making it a bigger text style, striking or an alternate shading. But make sure it flows within your email’s overall design; otherwise, you risk deterring prospective buyers.</span>
<h2><b>A Clear Call-to-Action </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One should never underestimate the role of </span><b><i>Call to Actions</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in any email marketing campaign. This is the only thing that will determine your open/conversion rate and the success of your email campaign. Therefore, Call to Action should be clearly visible and must include well-stated directions on what to do. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, there should be less number of CTAs especially when it comes to redeeming any offer or sales discount. The same you might have noticed in e-commerce emails when they send their EOS (End of Season sale).</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-7.02.17-PM-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18114 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-7.02.17-PM-1.png" alt="" width="469" height="621" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The big companies prefer to keep it simple and give only single or two CTAs to direct their readers on discounted landing pages. The longer and harder you make someone work for your offer the greater the chances are they will give up. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another of the most important thing you should keep in mind while creating effective email marketing campaigns- is the speed at which your landing page loads. The longer time a landing page takes to load, more it loses the interest. It&#8217;s a big turn off for readers/visitors. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The emails containing gifs or high-quality images on the emails slow downs the loading of the landing page. The loading should be fast and the design should be streamlined. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still not believe? then try this strategy with A/B email testing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create two emails with the same content with little variation in designs especially graphics. To learn A/B strategy, you can read our chapter &#8211; <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-email-marketing-course-how-to-use-a-b-tests-to-improve-your-email-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to use A/B testing to improve your email campaign</a>? Try it, you will definitely get convince with our approach. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Targeted Emails and Segmented Lists</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a human psychology that they won’t open an email if it&#8217;s not related to them. They won’t be interested to open your email that won’t interest them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep on sending irrelevant emails, they will barely glance your efforts or may unsubscribe you as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This should not be happening! It will be like the pain in your marketing strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, segment the list and target them as per your email strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Segmenting your email list is not a difficult task to undertake and will greatly increase your click-through and conversion rates. One of the email marketing tools, Mailchimp have stated in their reports that segmented customers had a click-through rate that was 21% higher than normal. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s great and it makes sense! Personalization is important; it makes the reader feel special and also shows them you are not going to waste their time with unnecessary emails.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some ideas of ways to segment your list:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By engagement level. You could even send a “re-engagement email” out to any inactive members you currently have.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By persona, like gender or job title.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By location.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on shopping history.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider your readers, brainstorm with your team and start segmenting! We can guarantee you will see some immediate results in your conversion rates.</span>
<h2><b>Great Copywriting</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality written content makes all the difference. That’s why marketers say </span><b><i>“<a href="https://digiperform.com/content-called-king-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content is King</a>!”</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have said it previously and we will presumably say it several more circumstances. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your emails should be engaging enough and clear about the product irrespective of whatever you have mentioned in the subject line of the email campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your content should invoke an emotional response with your reader; make them laugh, make them care and most importantly, gain their trust! </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use captivating headlines to catch their attention.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the content scannable by using bullets or breaking up large paragraphs of text.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write for your reader by using the correct language.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include keywords while keeping it natural.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include links that will directly land visitors/readers to the webpage (destination).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proofread for typos! This may sound self-evident, yet grammatical mistakes look awful. They ruin you and influence individuals to lose trust in your organization. So edit, edit again and after that ask another person on your group to edit it before you send it out. </span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Welcome Emails </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Welcome email is an extraordinary method to be in contact with new subscribers to thank them and express gratitude toward them for joining and let them recognize what&#8217;s in store. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibly you need to tell them how frequently they will get an email from you. You may likewise consider sending them an appreciated activity or an offer particularly held for new supporters.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/target-welcome-email.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18115 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/target-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="637" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the beginning of your relationship and this email is one of your initial introductions. Make them feel special and encourage them to engage with you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is likewise an extraordinary chance to guide them to your online social media pages or your blog so that can start following you on other channels. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be that as it may, what&#8217;s the best part about the welcome email? It can be automated! The moment another supporter agrees to accept your mailing list they will get this email from you without you doing a thing (well, aside from creating the email, to begin with, and keeping it up to date, of course). </span>
<h2><b>Reminder or Update Emails </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The way to send the update email is to comprehend the purchasing cycle of your client. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did they purchase a membership for a service you offer? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the point when does it expire? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than giving their subscription a chance to run out and hoping that they decide to renew, send them an email. Maybe you could even include an incentive to sign up for a longer subscription. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it simple for them to restore by incorporating a connection in your email where they can achieve it within a single click. The easier you can make this process the more likely they are to do it the minute they receive the email. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And guess what? These emails can be automated too; making it easier than ever to stay on top of your customer’s buying cycle. All you need is to have a good email marketing tool to follow all these.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter 6, you will be learning how to generate leads through email marketing campaign, what kind of email marketing strategy should be followed and what are the best practices to generate leads. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we discuss generating leads with email marketing campaign, it&#8217;s important to start what does it mean? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SO, what is a lead? Is this a form filled by the reader or brochure downloaded? or Maybe someone who attends a company-sponsored webinar?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, it differs from business-to-business. This is the hard truth that there is no particular type of lead generation. It varies as per the business requirements. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it can be a form when filled by the visitor, ebook downloaded, or even visiting the website, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only purpose of lead generation is that the individual should have a real interest in your category of product or service.</span>

<b><i>Generating a lead is very important part of any email campaign. </i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it’s a topmost role of any email marketer to create fledgling curiosity among the visitors (readers) and nurture it over time until it evolves into full-blown product interest or required action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best approach is to follow the right email marketing strategy to generate the leads for your businesses. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the real question becomes, what is required to create the right email marketing strategy, how to engage the thousands of visitors, how to maintain the interest among them, how to turn visitors into potential leads and what are the best practices to generate leads?</span>
<h2><b>Essentials of Email Marketing campaign to generate leads</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few essentials that one should keep in mind while creating email marketing campaigns. The pointers help to gear up the lead generation by following: </span>
<b>Subject Line:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The subject line is the one that decides whether an email will be read by the visitor or not; to the extent. So, spend time thinking about ways you can improve your subject line. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalize it. Subject lines should clearly address your business concern like: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">attend our webinar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">download our latest ebook</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/15-amazing-email-subject-lines-youll-probably-want-to-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17748 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Infographic-2-1-768x2078-1.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="898" /></b></a>
<b>Quickness:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your readers are already bombarded with massive amounts of email every day. Therefore, an email marketing campaign should be concise but engaging.</span>
<b>Visuals/Imagery:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Images or pictures generate more traffic than normal text messages. Also, using visuals fortify your duplicate content and convey your message rapidly to your target group.</span>
<b>Social Integration:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The content has no charm if it&#8217;s not shared by the visitors. Same is expected by email marketers as well that readers/visitors sharing the content or emails with their network. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to facilitate this is by incorporating social media sharing links into your emails. Additionally, each recipient of the email will have their own favorite social network so give them options to share on Google+, Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin.</span>
<b>CTA: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To effectively turn a visitor into lead or sale, the online marketer should create the content that will educate the readers about the products or services. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The way to educate them is to provide them with unlimited content through ebooks, videos, blogs, case studies, testimonials, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use action words like attend, download, register, read, and try now. Give them the next step to take after reading your email, like registering for an upcoming webinar.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18013 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-2.40.38-PM.png" alt="" width="530" height="203" />
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Best Practices to generate leads through your email marketing campaigns</b></h2>
<h2><b>1- Try not to Purchase Contact Lists </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is of no surprise, as we are already aware of the guidelines rollout by </span><b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with data consent. Email campaigns rely upon a sound open rate, and in case you&#8217;re reaching readers whose data you have purchased &#8211; instead of genuinely earned it &#8211; you&#8217;ll rapidly observe your messages&#8217; execution drop. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The GDPR additionally requires every European recipient’s assent before you connect with the users or visitors, and purchased email lists usually do not come with that consent.</span>
<h2><b>2- Use Incentives/Benefits to Increase Open Rates </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you incorporate a motivator/benefit in the subject line of your email campaign, you can increase open rates by as much as half. For example, &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free transporting when you shop for more than Rs 500</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; and &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a free iPod with demo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/493_big.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18046 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/493_big.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="427" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, be careful not to overwhelm your readers with savings- or product-related emails. Customer loyalty starts with casual industry insights &#8211; only then can you talk business.</span>
<h2><b>3- Avoid Using &#8216;No-Reply&#8217; in the Sender&#8217;s Email Address </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The one major rule to avoid your email fall into spam is to not-to-use </span><b><i>No-Reply</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (noreply@yourcompany.com) email addresses for your campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your agenda to send emails to your readers is to gain the trust and turn them into the lead.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/noreplymail.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18047 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/noreplymail.png" alt="" width="462" height="432" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“No-Answer” in an email keep readers from reacting and notwithstanding quitting further messages. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your clients are considerably more liable to open messages on the off chance that they know they were composed by an individual. </span>
<h2><b>4- Stick to Fewer Than Three Fonts in the Content </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The less mess you have in your email, the more chances you&#8217;ll get the open rate or leads. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try not to garbage up your email with more than two, or a most extreme of three font styles or typefaces. </span>
<h2><b>5- Clean Your Mailing List Regularly </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A portion of your email contacts probably won&#8217;t quit your email newsletters, yet at the same time never open your messages. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s enticing to email whatever number readers as would be prudent to achieve more prospects, however keeping your minimum connected with recipients on your mailing rundown can murder your open rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals who never open messages aggravate your battle look since you&#8217;re not investigating the campaign’s quality against your most loyal recipients. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Break down who hasn&#8217;t locked in with your messages over a specific timeframe, and keep on removing them on a regular basis. There is no point to keep junk in your subscribers&#8217; list. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives you a more precise email open rate and keeps your email campaign clean of the people who are no longer interested in hearing from you.</span>
<h2><b>6- Keep the Main Message and Call-to-Action Above the Fold </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your main call-to-action (CTA) falls below the fold, as many as 70% of recipients won&#8217;t see it. Also, any CTA should be repeated at least three times throughout the email in various places and formats.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17539 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email2.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="502" /></a>
<h2><b>7- Customize the Email Greeting </b></h2>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How regularly do you read messages that start, &#8220;Dear Member&#8221;? </span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You might segment your email audiences by the type of customer they are, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the first thing recipients see in your company messages. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always try to personalize the greeting of your emails with your contacts&#8217; first names as it grabs the attention of each reader right away.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to personalize the email by writing each name manually. Email marketing tools allow configuring the greeting of your email campaign so that it automatically sends with the name of the people on your contact list &#8211; so everyone is getting a personal version of the same message.</span>
<h2><b>8- Keep Your Email 500-650 Pixels Wide </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your email format is wider than 650 pixels, you&#8217;re requesting that readers scroll horizontally to read your entire message. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is much more bulky for a recipient who&#8217;s perusing your email on his or her cell phone. Your email pixel width is a basic segment of its lead-catching capacity. </span>
<h2><b>9- Put Your Logo in the Center or Upper Left-Hand Side of the Email </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye-tracking examinations have discovered that individuals naturally search for logos on the upper left-hand side or center of messages. Put your logo on the upper left-hand side to guarantee it gets the most permeability. </span>
<h2><b>10- Compose Compelling (But Concise) Subject Lines </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A decent subject line ought to contain somewhere in the range of 30 and 50 characters (counting spaces). </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email records and cell phones regularly remove any titles that go past this length. Your email subject line ought to likewise make a feeling of urgency while giving readers some indication of what to expect once they open the email.</span>
<h2><b>11- Utilize Auto-Responders for Opt-Ins </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be set up for your readers to forget they opted in. Set up an automated assistant that reminds readers that they have picked into your email database. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The automated responder ought to be conveyed one day, five days, and 10 days after the individual registers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every automated assistant/responder email ought to likewise incorporate content or bonus material to reward the reader for opting into the newsletter &#8212; or your readers might not feel they have enough incentive to actually opt-in. </span>
<h2><b>12- Direct Emails to Landing Pages </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the motives of any email campaign is to direct emails to landing pages. Therefore, landing pages need to match the emails in terms of headlines, content, visuals, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The look and description of email, as well as the landing page, should match each other. Also, you need to make sure you are using tracking tools to see which email campaign, as well as landing pages, are performing better and generating more leads. </span>
<h2><b>13- Try A/B email testing for each campaign</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have stated in our previous chapter &#8211; </span><a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-email-marketing-course-how-to-use-a-b-tests-to-improve-your-email-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Use A/B Tests To Improve Your Email Campaigns</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; where two identical campaigns should be presented among the two groups of your readers/visitors/subscribers with minor changes such as color, designs, graphics, call to actions, etc. with the same agenda to target the audience.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then analyze the performance of the emails and continue with the one which results great. </span>
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18000 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ab-testing-1.png" alt="" width="494" height="291" />

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here We Go!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email campaigns and newsletters are an extraordinary but effective method to retreat your business that adds more clients accordingly. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are times when you have tried everything in your email marketing strategy but still not able to decide whether the outcome is sufficient or not. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being an email marketer, it becomes very important to understand what is required to make your email marketing a success. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you are working on an email marketing campaign where you have shared ‘n’ number of emails to your subscribers i.e your database. Some of your subscribers have opened it and others may not. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a scenario, you need to understand what are the considerable measures or actions you have taken in the email campaign that has officially worked for you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, what’s more, you can add to improvise the open rate as well as the conversion rate of your email campaigns? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For same, you need to apply A/B testing theory that helps to experiment to create new effective marketing strategies. </span>

<b>What is A/B testing?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B testing,  which is also called as Split Testing in marketing language, is a method that helps you to test human reaction on your marketing campaign.  It’s a hypothesis about human behavior or reaction to your efforts. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The test can be based on many forms like testing the subject lines, formats, designs, content, call to actions, etc, of your email marketing campaigns. In an A/B test, people are split at random into two groups.</span>

<b>How does A/B Testing Campaigns Work?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the test, two identical campaigns are presented among the two groups with minor changes such as color, designs, graphics, call to actions, etc. with the same agenda to target the audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The original template is known as the </span><b>Control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the other is </span><b>Variation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (what are you actually testing with changes).</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ab-testing-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18000 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ab-testing-1.png" alt="" width="388" height="229" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After creating templates, you compare the performance of the variation against the performance of the control. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The performance is generally calculated in the form of open rate, click rate, conversion rate, engagement, etc.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the variation is more successful than your original template (the control),  you get an idea of what works for your marketing strategy. Therefore you can replace the old control with the new variation and use it for further tests as well.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/variatinwins.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17999 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/variatinwins.png" alt="" width="554" height="311" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the variation does not perform better than the control, then stick with what you have and try a new test to improve your results from the control.</span>

<b>What are the benefits of A/B testing your email campaign?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An A/B test has two main benefits:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives you data to back up what you think might be successful.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s probably the cheapest way you can improve your sales or conversions.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B testing can be used on almost anything you can think of: your design, email copy (in the body or subject), calls to action, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>A/B Testing Email Ideas To Improve Your Open Rates </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The subscribers open emails based on many reasons, like subject line, preview text appeal (especially on mobiles), sender, etc. You can A/B test variations of each to find what works best with your recipients.</span>
<h4><b>Idea 1: Send Your Email Campaigns At Different Times or Days </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To discover what works best with your prospect&#8217;s schedule, consider A/B testing:</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-12.50.05-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18004 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-12.50.05-PM.png" alt="" width="513" height="396" /></a>
<b>Day of the week:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While exploring email campaign by sending emails to thousands of subscribers, the study has found that messages sent during the weekend have higher open rates than weekdays. </span>
<b>Time of day:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Time plays a very important role in open rates. Constant Contact (one of the most commonly used email marketing tool) has released a report stating email marketing trends that recognize the day and time have more control on open rates.</span>
<h4><b>Idea 2:  Use of Personalized Statements or Questions In Your Subject Line </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the benefits of A/B testing that you can try various ways to examine the potential of your email marketing campaign. Like you can use “hey” in your subject line or start with Subscriber’s Name.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/personalize-prospecting-emails-example-four-1-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18007 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/personalize-prospecting-emails-example-four-1-1.png" alt="" width="591" height="422" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is your playground, try new ways and analyze the performance. You can try A/B testing email questions within your own messaging. </span>
<h4><b>Idea 3: Change The First Line Of Your Email </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first sentence of your message often appears as a snippet of preview text in your recipient’s inbox. Getting this right message through the snippet can increase your open rates by up to 45%.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s roughly 40 to 90 characters to experiment with, depending on the email app or tool.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preview.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-18009 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/preview.png" alt="" width="434" height="210" /></a>
<h4><b>Idea 4: Use of Long vs Short Subject Lines in Your Email Campaign</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers have always suggested using fewer characters in subject lines of your email marketing campaign. Short and precise is always in. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because, if we compare with mobiles; </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPhone only shows 35-38 characters in portrait mode (compared to 80 in landscape). </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Galaxy S4 constricts subject lines even further, showing only 33 characters in portrait mode.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, there is no use of having typically more characters in your subject lines. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your subject line is typically over 50 characters, then this is a good reason that you should go for A/B test your subject line. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally one should aim for less than five words.</span>
<h4><b>Idea 5: Capitalize All, One, Or None Of The Words (Letters) In Your Subject Line </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strikingly, the email marketing tool MailChimp has realized during the testing that an altogether capitalized form of title bring out about somewhat higher than normal open rates. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The split test Campaign by MailChimp discovered what works best; is to send a title case headline to Campaign A and a lowercase one to Campaign B. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to analyze performance better. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ab-testing-email-capitaliation2-768x279.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18008 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ab-testing-email-capitaliation2-768x279.png" alt="" width="534" height="194" /></a>
<h4><b>Idea 6: Personalize the Subject Line </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempt A/B testing a similar email body with two distinctive titles one non-specific, the other with a custom field that personalizes your message to the recipient. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few examples to test: </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Include and preclude &#8220;you.&#8221; → How you can win in 2016 / How to win in 2016 </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporate your Recipient&#8217;s first name → Quick inquiry, {!First Name}/Quick question(Here are the means by which to customize up to 200 messages immediately with custom fields) </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Say your prospect&#8217;s part/occupation → Sales representatives love this / People love this </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize their organization → {!My company} + {!Your company} = {benefit}/{!My company} = {benefit} </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: If you&#8217;re sending a Campaign, ensure you have a placeholder for any contacts whose data you may miss (ex: you don&#8217;t have a first name for somebody&#8217;s email address).</span></i>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-2.37.34-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18011 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-2.37.34-PM.png" alt="" width="540" height="432" /></a>
<h4><b>Idea 7: Subject lines with high Emotional value or showing empathy </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotions drive actions. In any case, did you realize that you can really quantify the level of passionate as well as emotional effect your headline has?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This calculation is known as </span><b>Emotional Marketing Value (EMV).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s utilized to evaluate how a cluster of words (like a headline) may inspire an emotional reaction from a reader by speaking to one&#8217;s judgment, empathy, or otherworldliness.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/intel.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18010 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/intel.png" alt="" width="768" height="161" /></a>
<h4><b>Idea 8: Longer vs Shorter Emails </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can your messages be grabbed in 8 seconds by the readers? If not, you may lose the consideration of your readers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a simple format to convey your message and add a short but crisp message to it. Your readers’ time is very precious. Utilize in a smart way. </span>
<h4><b>Idea 9: Keep Changing your  Call To Action (CTA) </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the piece of your email where you request that your reader’s action. The ultimate purpose behind CTAs could be anything like, directing to the website, download the brochure, clicking to comments, etc…. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA variations to A/B test:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting your request towards the top of the email, vs at the very end</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underlining, bolding or italicizing your ask, vs plain text</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for a specific time to meet vs. asking “what works best” for them</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for a shorter amount of time vs longer → ex. “Do you have 5 minutes?” vs “Do you have 15 minutes?”</span></li>
</ul>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-2.40.38-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18013 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-2.40.38-PM.png" alt="" width="499" height="191" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To locate your enchantment email, send a variant with your standard inquiry versus the improved inquire. </span>

<b>A/B Testing Emails for Click Rate </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the point when a reader clicks your email, you realize that something appealed to them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To capture their attention longer and understand what resources are resonating, try one of these A/B tests.</span>
<h4><b>Idea 10: Different Types Of Content Formats </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your subscribers like to watch, tune in, or read the content you send them? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing which content formats get the most clicks will give you a better idea of the types of resources you should share with similar prospects in the future. Try linking out to:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written case studies vs video case studies</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasts vs blog posts</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web pages as PDFs </span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Idea 11: Link Formatting </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People click on links that are easy to spot in the content. If you usually include your links in-line with your text, try a version “B” where you bold your link and enter it onto its own line. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">See how the above link lists a metric? It’s another strategy to increase clicks. The more specific you are, the more persuasive your link is. Using a precise number makes your story more trustworthy in the eyes of your recipient.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plaintext-expedia.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18014 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plaintext-expedia.png" alt="" width="580" height="349" /></a>
<h4><b>Idea 12: Link Text Length </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As indicated by MailChimp, 8-12 words are the connection sweet spot. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that your connection content is typically well above or under 8-12 words, experiment with this strategy by A/B testing your standard email with another, improved form. </span>
<h4><b>Idea 13: Use Anchor Text To Appeal To Curiosity, Empathy, or FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s the manner by which to test which emotional appeals or interests work best to convince your contacts to take a look at what you&#8217;re sharing: </span>
<h4><b>Idea 14: Vary The Number Of Links </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Less is more. According to the ‘paradox of choice,’ theory, the more choices we have, the more unlikely we are to make any decision at all.</span>

<strong>End Part……&#8230;</strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope with this chapter,  you have understood why A/B testing is important and how it can help you to improve your click as well as conversion rates of email marketing campaign. </span>

<h4></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In chapter 4 of the email marketing course, we are going to discuss how to measure the effectiveness of your email marketing campaign? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you start creating your email marketing strategy, you create email templates to share your business information like a product launch, product sale, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all your email marketing campaign can go in vain if it&#8217;s not properly planned and measured the effectiveness. </span>
<em><strong>Email effectiveness is a broad phrase for marketers as well as businessmen to describe the success of their email marketing campaigns.</strong></em>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email campaign success doesn’t include creating and shooting emails to your clients. It has a very broad concept. Like, it includes how many of your subscribers opened your emails, how many emails got bounced, how many have reached to the right audience, and so on. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But before measuring the effectiveness of your email campaign, you need to clear your ultimate goals for your email marketing campaign. There is no point to create the campaigns if you don’t know what are your goals and how you even begin working on strategy, execution and reporting. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t worry! We are here to clear all your doubts and concern regarding related to the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns; like,</span>
<ul>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So here we go!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the first question We would like to answer that must have popped up in your mind i.e; </span><b>“Should I measure opens or clicks?”</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is </span><b>YES!</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and common goal of any email marketing campaign is to analyze the open or click rates. The success of the email campaign opens or clicks within the email. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We, humans, get irritated easily whenever we see anything in abundance. Like if you are jammed up with ‘n’ number of emails, would you open each and every email? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess no! Then what about your email where you have shared your the launch of your product? You want your email to be unread or get into the trash. Of course No!</span>
<b><i>“This is the reason why measuring opening or clicking rate is very important. Because of the volume of emails that an individual receives on a daily basis, using clicks or click-through rate, is a superior measure of effectiveness.”</i></b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emails are the backbone of any online marketing campaign. It is a channel that helps to support as well as influence your overall marketing strategy. Also, the opening and clicking email would suggest your effort is on the right track which can lead to an impact on your organization&#8217;s ROI. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An ideal marketer would determine the performance of an email campaign. He/she would be well aware of the important metrics that they should be measuring on a regular basis if you want to maintain email list health and improve the ROI of your campaigns. </span>
<h2><b>Important Email Marketing Metrics to Measure</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are few important email marketing metrics that you need to measure your email marketing campaign on a weekly or daily basis. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s take a look at the metrics…</span>
<h2><b>Open Rate</b></h2>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/open.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17738 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/open.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="282" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your emails are usually sent to large lists that indicate that your potential audience; however, the actual number who have an interest in your business and the one who will read your emails. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though whatever is the size of your list, the percentage of emails that are opened to read is your actual valid potential audience. The percentage is called the open rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an important metric to measure the effectiveness of your email marketing campaign. It helps to know that your subscribers are actually opening your email and reading them. </span>

<h2><b>Click-Through Rate</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another important metric to determine the effectiveness of your email marketing campaign. An ideal email always has at least one </span><b>Call-To-Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that determines how much interest have shown by the audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Call-to-Action generally promotes a service, feature, or product that business offers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The click rate tells you how effective these call to actions in your email campaign. These rates give you a  percentage of how many times a link within the email is clicked versus how many messages were sent. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The click-through rate will always be equal to or less than the open rate because the user has to open your email in order to click any of the links.</span>

<h2><b>Unsubscribe Rate</b></h2>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-5.57.56-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17741 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-5.57.56-PM.png" alt="" width="726" height="324" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many times when a marketer keeps on focussing on the number of increasing subscribers rather than focussing on unsubscribers. It’s very important to keep an eye on your unsubscribed audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to look at common patterns why they are unsubscribing you or removing themselves from the list. The reason can be any; content, interest, favoritism (favorite brand), number of emails, etc. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just keep a track on the same and unsubscribe rate which is the percentage of your email recipients who clicked on the “unsubscribe” link inside your email due to XYZ reason. </span>

<h2><b>Conversion Rate</b></h2>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-6.01.45-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17744 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-6.01.45-PM.png" alt="" width="684" height="221" /></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversion builds upon the effectiveness of open rate, click rate, and call to actions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It determines that the user is responding and taking an action like purchasing your product, downloading brochure, etc; depending on what type of call to actions you have used in your email marketing campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversion rate will always be the lowest of the three main measures because it requires the user to take the action you intend. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your conversion rate is the percentage of your email recipients who completed your desired action (e.g. purchasing a product).</span>

<h2><b>Bounce Rate</b></h2>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bounce.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17735 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bounce.png" alt="" width="625" height="286" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most important parameter to decide how effective is your email marketing list. This factor is completely different from the open rate, conversion rate or click rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bounce rate gives you an indication of the quality of your mailing list. In other words, it suggests how many email addresses are valid in your emailing list. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus there are generally two types of bounces in email marketing;</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the soft bounce is mail messages that are returned for a variety of reasons like his or her mailbox is full, etc.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the hard bounce, where the users&#8217; email address is invalid or the mail server can not be reached.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bounce rate is the percentage of your total emails sent which weren’t successfully delivered to your recipient’s inbox.</span>

<h2><b>Forward/Share Rate</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every email marketer is advised to use social media sharing buttons to create more visibility and engagement for your business. These sharing buttons help your subscribers to forward your email to a friend or share your email by clicking on the share button inside your email. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This may not seem like an important metric to measure, but it’s a really good thing to try and increase. If your existing leads are forwarding your emails, that means they are actually becoming ambassadors of your brand and generating new leads for you.</span>

<h2><b>Campaign ROI</b></h2>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/revenue.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17734 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/revenue.png" alt="" width="684" height="325" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your email marketing campaign is nothing if it doesn’t generate ROI. Let’s read a little about it.</span>
<b>What It Is:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The overall return on investment for your email campaigns. In other words, the total revenue divided by total spend.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As with every marketing channel, you should be able to determine the overall ROI of your email marketing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your campaign ROI is the overall return on your investment for your email campaign.</span>

<h2><b>Growth Rate</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately what will be the role of an email marketing campaign if it won’t help you to grow your email marketing list. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from open rate, click rate, call to actions, conversion rate; you also need to make a track of the growth of your email marketing list. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This should be your at least secondary aim to grow the mailing list in order to extend your reach, expand your audience, and position yourself as an industry thought leader.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your list growth rate is the rate at which your email list has grown over a certain period of time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, as we have shared what is the basis of email marketing metrics that you should be tracking to now the effectiveness of the email marketing campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take a look at some parameters &#8211; how to figure out where to focus your efforts to make your email marketing campaign &#8211; A Success. </span>
<h2><b>Here are the three ways to focus to create a successful email marketing campaign:</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><b> Experiment With Your Subject Lines</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/15-amazing-email-subject-lines-youll-probably-want-to-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email subject lines</a> are the first piece of content that readers see even before opening your emails. We agree, subject lines are not easy to create but it is the first hurdle to work on if you want a successful email marketing campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email subject lines help to determine the open rate. For a successful email campaign, design at least two different subject lines for your emails like as we do in A/B testing and split your campaign for testing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep things fresh and write some winners, keep these strategies in mind:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoke immediacy and excitement.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use words aligned with your brand.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember: People like to see their own names and even shout-outs to their cities.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use 50 characters or less—that’s all most mobile device displays can fit.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as you don’t duplicate content online for SEO reasons, don’t reuse subject lines, either.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is always a good practice to run A/B tests on subject lines. It will help you to understand your audience&#8217;s behavior and open rate stating whether they open the email or trash it.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Infographic-2-1-768x2078-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17748 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Infographic-2-1-768x2078-1.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="1318" /></a>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Use Many Anchors for the Same Link</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-6.14.48-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-17749 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-6.14.48-PM.png" alt="" width="484" height="329" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As your primary goal in email marketing is to get more and more visitors to your website or landing page, that can be accomplished only with the right set of Calls to actions and anchor links. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The content with appropriate anchor links would get to work nurturing visitors along their sales journey. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out how well your emails accomplish that, you need to track click-through rates (CTR) for your links. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An increase in CTR means more readers are finding your content applicable and actionable (and clickable).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try this two-step approach:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link to the same piece of the site contains more than once in a single email.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a different language to describe each link. These are the words that appear underlined and in a different color, also called “anchor text.”</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Track Engagement Rates, Not Just Open Rates</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to figure out how long people spend their time reading your email. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your email content engaging enough? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they actually reading them? </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These things you can easily measure with the help of email marketing tools you are using like MailChimp, GetResponse, AWeber, etc.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With these tools, you can even analyze that they are just opening the emails or being served a preview by their inbox applications. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However if the audience is deleting them, then the engagement rate will be less than two seconds.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes at least six seconds to develop an impression of just one part of your email content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything between three and seven seconds should be considered a “skim rate” metric; a “read rate” means emails are open eight seconds or more.</span>
<h2><b>Use UTM Code Generator</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to know if your email campaign is effective is by using UTM codes. What is a UTM code? An Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) code refers to a snippet of simple code that’s added to the end of a URL. UTMs are also called tracking tags because they allow you to track the origin of the website traffic. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary function of a UTM code is to track the performance of sales and marketing campaigns and the performance of web content. The URL parameters you can track include the source (root), medium (ways used), campaign (like email campaign), term, and content.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the good-to-know facts about UTM codes: </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) are regular Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), but with a maximum of five variables or parameters added, which are processed by Google Analytics. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The source parameter tells you the website sending you traffic. For example, you can use a UTM code to your Facebook or Instagram page to track all traffic coming from your social media pages.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; To help improve your traffic, UTMs can be set up with other Analytics tools to generate relevant data. The corresponding data will be seen in your email campaigns, giving instant insight into the specific UTM code&#8217;s performance. Use a UTM code to determine the traffic coming from your email campaign, which reflects the effectiveness of your headlines and email content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; While you can add the UTM parameters to your desired URL on your own, it’ll take more time. You can use a trusted </span><a href="https://utmstar.com/utm-generator/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UTM code generator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to generate the best UTM code you can use for your next email campaign. With a UTM generator, you can place the URL and then fill out the data for various parameters. Once it’s done, your UTM link is ready to use.</span>
<h2><b>Conclusion:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you know the effectiveness of your content and the working of your email marketing campaign, you can add much value to your campaign than any ordinary message. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With these email marketing metrics, you will be able to measure the engagement of your audience as well.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering that kind of juice to opted-in inboxes will send that many more engaged visitors to your site (and more informed, mature leads to the sales team). What else you need!</span>
