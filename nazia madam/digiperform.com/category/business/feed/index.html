										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="pix-el-text w-100  " ><p class="  text-body-default  " ><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a company owner, you know that <a href="https://clientvenue.com/">aligning the workforce with the organization’s business objectives</a> is not the easiest task. However, if you want to thrive and succeed in the long run, it’s an absolute necessity.<br />
<br><br>One of the best ways organizations can meet their goals is by providing a top-notch employee experience through the implementation of effective employee marketing strategies.</span><br />
<br><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">A workforce that demonstrates a commitment to their organizations and knows how to achieve its visions and mission gives the company unique competitive advantages such as higher productivity.  Building the right internal marketing strategies depends on many factors such as employee job satisfaction, employee turnover rate, and how good the company’s hiring decisions are.</span><br />
<br><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, you can read more about what employee marketing means and how certain strategies can help you drive business objectives, create a better company culture, improve customer service, recruit, engage, and retain top talent.</span></p></div><div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_white" ><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h3 class="text-black font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">What Is Employment Marketing?</h3></div></div></div><div class="pix-el-text w-100  " ><p class="  text-body-default  " ><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/04/15/why-employment-marketing-is-beneficial-to-your-hiring-process-and-how-to-get-started/#:~:text=What%20is%20employment%20marketing%3F,their%20employer%20images%20and%20strengths."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is aimed at building a strong brand and promoting the brand’s core values, goals and culture. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate what makes your organization different or unique. The employer&#8217;s brand image has an impact on recruiting, talent retention, and overall reputation and perception of your company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of employee marketing is to create an emotional connection with the company and brand, resulting in increased enthusiasm and employee engagement. When you treat your employees like customers and market the company to them, while sharing important information, you will attain greater productivity, successfully manage internal communication and align your workforce.</span></p></div><div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_white" ><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h3 class="text-black font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">Introducing Core Values</h3></div></div></div><div class="pix-el-text w-100  " ><p class="  text-body-default  " ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your priority should be to make the employee marketing strategies creative and adapted to your company. One way is to </span><a href="https://www.hoppier.com/blog/lunch-and-learn-ideas-for-your-client-events"><span style="font-weight: 400;">host a virtual lunch and learn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an informal training session that takes place over lunch where you can communicate the company’s core values and mission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is important when wanting to establish the company culture and this type of event will allow you to be transparent with employees. Use it to tell them what they’re expected to do when working for the organization and ensure they can deliver on those exact promises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your company values open communication, employees are more likely to communicate openly on the job. This means sharing thoughts and ideas about their work and company projects, initiatives, and goals.</span></p></div><div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_white" ><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div><div  class="pix-heading-el text-left "><div><div class="slide-in-container"><h3 class="text-black font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12" style="" data-anim-type="" data-anim-delay="0">Onboarding Programs</h3></div></div></div><div class="pix-el-text w-100  " ><p class="  text-body-default  " >An onboarding program is another excellent employee marketing strategy for employers to use and win the hearts and minds of new employees. It allows new employees to get familiarized with company procedures and culture and provides significant benefits in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and retention.</p>
<p>In the course of this program, prospective employees will be able to learn more about the company’s beginnings, core values, and mission statement. In addition, they will learn about their co-workers and their expected role within the organization.</p>
<p>To stop employees from leaving the company, employers can improve their onboarding processes and make the entire experience more memorable and link it to the positive company culture.</p></div><div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_white" ><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has shown that disengaged workers have no emotional or psychological attachment to their company and solely work for the paycheck benefit. Organizing office-wide contests, training and mentorship programs, volunteer opportunities and work-life balance programs are all examples of excellent worker engagement programs that will result in a happier workforce, increased productivity, high morale, and reduced employee turnover.</span></p></div><div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_white" ><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>

Employees need to know what they are representing, why it is crucial, and how they should protect the brand.</p>
<p>This provides employees with the right tools to become better brand ambassadors but also helps them show more empathy toward customers. Educating employees on brands can help them work better together and build a positive company culture.</p></div><div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_white" ><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>

If you have an effective employee advocacy program in place, your company can boost its brand awareness and increase sales. A good employee advocacy program rewards employees who share company content and interact with customers.</p>
<p>You can accomplish this by encouraging your employees to share company content on various social media and review sites. When recommending a company’s product or service, they generate brand exposure.</p></div><div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_white" ><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current world entrepreneurs are high-risk takers. This is evident if you see how small start-ups are booming within the gap of one or two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 and the years to come, the number of small businesses and small start-ups will increase as the world of consumers does not seem to stop in terms of what they need. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, many businesses have switched to the online platform, selling everything online as they used to do in the offline and regular market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-38986 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-digi-300x196.png" alt="Which Business Will Be Ruling The Next 5 Years" width="386" height="252" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-digi-300x196.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-digi.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are planning to start your own business, you are probably looking for ideas to start your business around. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why we have listed several business ideas with a bright future. In this article, we have talked about several businesses which will rule the next five years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Top Businesses That Will Rule The Future</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some businesses that will rule the upcoming years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>App Development</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you skilled in app development? If you are, why are you even wondering </span><a href="https://realwealthbusiness.com/how-start-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to start a business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The world of technology is only expanding and improving, and the need for mobile apps is far from over. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are adept in the skills of app development, then you can build your career around app development. This business sector is currently dominating the digital market, and it will keep ruling in the future. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3D Printing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are indeed many business ideas that you can invest in 2022. But some ideas among them are incredibly profitable given their scope in revolutionizing several sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3d Printing, for instance, is another profitable business opportunity for the coming years. Earlier, many businessmen and </span><b>businesswomen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could not afford a 3D printer since they were very expensive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as time passes and technology improves, 3D Printers have become cheaper and more affordable. So, it offers a huge business opportunity for the coming future. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Healthcare Industry</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the global population increases, the number of diseases also increases immensely due to changes in human lifestyles. Doubtlessly, the need for healthcare workers, healthcare equipment, and supplies become necessary. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The healthcare industry will grow even bigger and more extensive in the future. So, if you are planning to invest in a sustainable industry, then the healthcare industry is indeed a good one to consider. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Freelance Writing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need is to be crafty with words and marketing to get started with copywriting. Many businesses in the world need copywriters, so the opportunities for making a business around your skill as a copywriter are incredibly immense. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, many companies need writers for their blogs; you can be a freelance content writer and provide your clients with the content they need. If you can put a bit of SEO knowledge, then the price of your service will increase even more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Digital Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the digital world, you cannot resort to traditional marketing if you want your business to grow and thrive. Newspaper print ads and billboards are way past our generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best place for marketing anything is the place with the most public gathering. Currently, the internet is where many people spend most of their day. Therefore, digital marketers target this online ecosystem to promote various businesses and brands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is a cheaper solution than the other modes of marketing; as a result, many businesses need digital marketing solutions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small digital marketing business startup, you can provide your clients with marketing solutions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>CBD</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD oils are hugely required materials in the current medical industry. There are many benefits of CBD in the pharmaceutical industry; for instance, it helps treat Epilepsy Syndromes, anxiety, depression, unmanageable pain, and it helps with diabetic complications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manufacturing of CBD oils has interested many entrepreneurs in getting into this business. This is one of the businesses that will rule the future business world. </span></p>
<p>One thing that is evident in the rise of this industry is the number of promo codes like the <a href="https://shipthedeal.com/store/herb-approach-coupon-code">Herb Approach coupon</a> codes online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Solar Energy</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the global population increases, the need for more reliable energy sources is immense. But unfortunately, exhaustive energy sources like thermal energy cannot sustain human civilization for long. As a result, many manufacturing companies are now investing their money into improving solar panels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking for a futuristic business to invest in, you should consider Solar energy. Instead of investing in the </span><a href="https://worthytoshare.net/most-undervalued-stocks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most undervalued stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can rather choose to start a solar energy business. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Small Restaurants</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably the most evergreen business option on the list here. If you are looking for a small business, opening up a small restaurant is great. If you are fond of foods and feeding, then a </span><a href="https://tourandtravelblog.com/cafe-coffee-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small restaurant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the evergreen business choice you should opt for. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many business opportunities to look for when talking about a business that will thrive in the coming years. For example, you can start a freelance writing business, a cleaning service, 3D Printing, or an app development business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of these businesses, you need a good </span><a href="https://newsprofy.com/best-marketing-strategies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to generate constant revenue. Again, you can take reference from the business options talked about in this article.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many of you have used the same password for more than one account? Do you use the same pin code for your online banking as you do your Netflix account? While this may be convenient, it puts you at great risk of identity fraud from an account takeover account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that </span><a href="https://www.security.org/digital-safety/account-takeover-annual-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24 million households in the United States have experienced account takeovers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? An attack like this results in a loss of almost $12,000 on average. The last thing we want is for you to be part of this statistic. That is why we have put together this helpful guide on account takeovers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What is Account Takeover?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account takeover is a type of fraud or identity theft, whereby a malicious third party is able to successfully gain access to a person’s account credentials.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cybercriminal will pose as a genuine user so that they can use stolen information to get access to other accounts within an organization, steal sensitive data or financial information, send out phishing emails, and change account details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h4>How an Account Takeover Attack is Performed</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are typically four lifecycles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Credential acquisition </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The initial step involves getting ahold of the account names and passwords of a target. There are a number of different methods of acquiring them. Moreover, as a consequence of huge data breaches and leaks, there are </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/07/08/new-dark-web-audit-reveals-15-billion-stolen-logins-from-100000-breaches-passwords-hackers-cybercrime/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of data credentials currently being traded on the dark web</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Credential testing </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; No matter how the attacker managed to get hold of the username and password combinations in question, the next likely step is to test them. Testing can be done automatically or manually by using bots. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Action </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; At this point, the logins will have either worked or been unsuccessful. If they worked, the hacker is now able to manipulate the accounts that have been seized. For example, money could be withdrawn from a bank account. The action taken here depends on the type of account and the nature and reason for the attack. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Consecutive attacks </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; A lot of </span><a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/92331-of-people-admit-they-reuse-the-same-password-for-multiple-accounts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people use the same password again and again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for different accounts. In fact, 53 percent of people have admitted they do this. If you do this, it puts you in harm’s way because it means that once the hacker has access to one account, he or she likely has access to many others. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How to Prevent Account Takeover</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know what account takeover is, it is imperative to take steps to prevent it. Here are seven ways you can do so:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Use modern bot mitigation software</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are trying to respond to bot attacks with various methods that have proven to be unsatisfactory. A prime example of this is CAPTCHA. This involves different puzzles that require users to prove they are human. Basically, the user needs to jump through hoops, which can be very frustrating. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in CAPTCHA, users must interpret an image that has numbers and letters mashed together. Another common example is when you are presented with nine squares, each containing different images, and you have to select all of the ‘boats’ or ‘traffic lights.’</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/4003160?ref=solrAll&amp;refval=303836448"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gartner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has revealed that these methods are repeatedly being beaten by cloud-based analysis tools and attacker bots. So, not only are you frustrating the user but you can’t be sure that you are going to beat the bot either!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such prevention methods have damaging effects on businesses, causing a 50 percent abandonment rate by users, particularly those shopping on their smartphones. Therefore, for every two customers that have to complete the CAPTCHA, one will leave and not complete their purchase. This is why you need to use a modern solution that will force the bot to do the work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Watch for indicators of API misuse</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIs are vital today in terms of connecting and integrating various web services together. They are basically the internet’s glue! For instance, a merchant could utilize an API for connecting its online store to the payment processor so credit card transactions can be cleared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they are highly useful tools for developers and businesses, bad scots can misappropriate them in an account takeover scenario. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By utilizing an automated attack bot, threat actors could attempt to break through the security controls of the API using random combinations of stolen passwords and usernames. This is one of the reasons why monitoring websites for API misuse is critical, as it will probably incorporate a sizable number of failed login attempts within a short timeframe. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Use fraud management filters</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an e-commerce website, it makes sense to use fraud management filters. There are two main options here:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Threshold filters </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; You can set maximums and minimums for legitimate purchases. For example, if all of the items you sell are more than $20, this sort of filter would automatically flag a purchase made for $1. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Velocity filters </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; You can stop threat actors from testing card numbers against your merchant account by declining suspicious transactions automatically based on a number of parameters in a set timeframe. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Monitor your online presence with Google Alerts</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up Google Alerts so you have a better understanding of your online presence. You can turn on automatic notifications, alerting you whenever Google indexes a website that mentions the name of your company, including dummy websites pretending to be you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Use advanced fraud detection software</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the tips that we have provided so far, it is also important to make sure that you use fraud detection software.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of different solutions to select from, so you need to make sure you choose with care. The </span><a href="https://seon.io/resources/the-best-fraud-detection-and-prevention-software-tools/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEON fraud detection software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good choice. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of great features that you can expect, including complete data enrichment based on phone number, IP address, or email address, as well as a way of checking 40+ online networks and social media accounts relating to user information. In-depth device fingerprinting is also available. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also expect full control over risk rules. You can even use a powerful machine learning engine, which will give you powerful suggestions based on historical company data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Monitor for accounts being accessed from IP addresses in different countries</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers tend to use the same IP address and computer when accessing their accounts. As IP addresses are connected with specific locations, they can be used for monitoring whether a user has logged in from an unexpected location.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The IP addresses of active site users can also be matched to the usual IP address of the account holder. For instance, if an account holder typically based in California is accessing the website from an IP address in Nigeria, there is likely to be one of two scenarios. The first is that they have gone away on a vacation. The second is that an account takeover is happening. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another sign of an account takeover is when there are a number of unique account logins from a new location within a short space of time. For example, if 15 different accounts are accessed from a new country, we can assume that the customers in question have not all taken a trip to the same country at the same time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. Educate yourself on account takeovers</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of different ways an account can be compromised. Below, we will provide some insight into some of the popular methods hackers use to steal account credentials:  </span></p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>1. Credential stuffing</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a cyber attack whereby account details (specifically username and password pairs) are stolen. These sorts of attacks are automated via large-scale login requests, which are directed at a web application. </span></p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>2. SIM card swapping</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIM swapping is a legit service that phone companies provide whereby a user will switch phone and the new device they receive is not compatible with the SIM card. Fraudsters are manipulating this process, transferring the phone number of the victim to a new SIM card. Once they have done this, they can get in touch with the mobile phone carrier, convincing the call center to port the mobile phone to an illegal phone number</span></p>
<h5></h5>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Phishing </span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a form of cybercrime that tends to be characterized by email span. Email is still the most targeted online service, with the greatest potential for identity theft. Malicious people could pose as your bank and ask for you to change your account passwords as part of a security protocol, hoping that you will fall straight into their trap so that they can steal your information or infect your device. </span></p>
<h5></h5>
<h5>4. Online hacking</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online hackers use keyloggers and other forms of malware to track the keyboard input of data so they can steal it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Final words on account takeover</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there you have it: seven tips on spotting and preventing account takeover. This is something all businesses, no matter how big or small, need to concern themselves with today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to make a dedicated effort to ensure that you effectively monitor for the possibility of account takeover while using modern software so that you can put the right measures in place to keep your business protected. </span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Is this going to be the year in which you quit the rat race? Or at least choose your own route for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People are job-hopping more than ever. Platforms like Fiverr make the gig economy stronger than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Plus, ever since we’ve all started working from home, we discovered that it’s actually quite cool to manage yourself, your time, and your projects—without someone physically looking over your shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unsurprisingly, a lot more people are finally discovering their entrepreneurial side, either by starting side-projects, or even by just taking the dive without any floaties like a permanent contract at a job they secretly hate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you also ready to take that plunge, but not sure yet in what direction to jump? You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, you could just take parts of your current job and start doing that independently—like many social media managers turned freelance copywriters do. But maybe you’re looking to do a complete 180, and want a job that fits the times we live in, matches with your passions, and doesn&#8217;t feel like a job at all, actually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’re not going to tell you how virtual assistants are in great demand and that dog sitting is fun. Instead, we’ve gathered 12 creative and fun ideas to inspire your entrepreneurial adventure. Ready to go?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Become a crypto coach</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you one of those people who somehow understand cryptocurrencies—and maybe even NFTs—and have you been successfully investing in all the right coins? That’s a great way to make an (extra) income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what if you could do more with all that knowledge? People are reading up about it, but at the end of the day, it’s a lot more comforting when someone actually tells you how and when to buy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s say, you know all about how to </span><a href="https://www.moonpay.com/buy/btc"><span style="font-weight: 400">buy BTC on Moonpay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, or any other type of bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could become a one-on-one coach about this, or even create an online course, to make this side-hustle all the more scalable.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>2. Start an at-home cooking service</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do your friends and family often come over to devour your food? Are you a master at meal prepping and making something amazing from the weirdest leftovers someone has in their fridge?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then you’re lucky, first of all. Many people struggle to come up with a pasta dish that isn&#8217;t the same as yesterday’s (and the ten days before) if they even have time to cook at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, you might not want to become a professional chef and spend most of your nights and weekends in a kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could consider starting a delivery service, but that would mean you’d spend more time driving around than cooking—and you want to do what you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">love</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So if you’re a talented cook, consider starting a local business where you go to other people&#8217;s houses to meal prep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can opt to do the groceries and create meals for the entire week in their kitchen—which also saves you your own kitchen and sanity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While this is a little of an upscale type of service, there are surely plenty of people around who are tired of the same old take-away every day and would love to try your fresh food!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Make yourself a hyper-specialized social media expert</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, social media marketing isn&#8217;t necessarily the most original job. But the big boys aren&#8217;t looking for generalists anymore, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their Instagram and LinkedIn are up and running, they just want to turn it into a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">success</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. So if you know how to use any platform like no one else, offer that as a service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, offer engagement services for Instagram. Or help people write great LinkedIn pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more specific it gets, the easier it’ll become to sell to people who already know what they’re doing—but acknowledge they need your help.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Become a remote work trainer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’ve been a digital nomad since before 2020, or you adapted incredibly easily, you’ve got a lot of valuable skills to teach others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people who are used to cubicles or trendy open-plan offices are still struggling with managing remote work. Which means their employers are also struggling with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can sell yourself to organizations as a remote work coach who will help them get the most out of their current employees, teaching them healthy ways to manage their work-life balance and boost their productivity. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Sell yourself as an ergonomic expert</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing on the previous point: a lot of people think they&#8217;ve got their home office routine completely under control. Meanwhile, they sound like a firecracker every time they get up for another cup of coffee. But no, they’re fine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’ve been working as a physiotherapist or in any other related field, and know a thing or two about working in a healthy position, market yourself to people who are working from home and don&#8217;t want to break their backs in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the right value proposition and laser-targeted market, plus maybe some referral deals and affiliate marketing with furniture stores, this could be a rather profitable business—and you’ll do a little good for others as well.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>6. Finally start that food truck!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this is not the time to recommend anyone to open a restaurant, we’re well aware. But if it&#8217;s always been a dream of yours, and you don&#8217;t like to be at the same place all the time anyway, why not open a food truck?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Admittedly, this is not a new concept, but it&#8217;s still a booming business, and perfectly fits the time we live in of outdoor events and being flexible. You could even use it to travel a little further and further because your market will simply be wherever you go.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h3>7. Travel planner for digital nomads</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oddly specific, right? That’s just how we like it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since remote work is becoming more accepted and standardized, people are dipping their toes into actual travel and work, instead of working from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if you think choosing a holiday destination is difficult, wait until you have to find a destination that has fast enough Wi-Fi to zoom your boss, has plenty of coworking spaces or at least coffee places that won&#8217;t kick you out when you type too loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of digital nomads have been there, done that, and if that’s you, consider helping people find their way in this world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could create guides on specific places and sell them, or make it all the more personal (and valuable!) by becoming a personal travel planner. You could even offer this service to companies who are encouraging their employees to use this time to explore the world while still getting the job done, for even more impact. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Become <i>that</i> specialized tour guide in your own city</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Live in a pretty place and know all about it? Now that tourism is starting to come back, you could use this coincidence to make a little money—while also getting out of the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there are plenty of standard businesses you could join to become a generic tour guide, pointing at the landmarks nobody was going to miss anyway. But with your specific, personal touch to it, you could make it into a little business too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, maybe you know all the best wine bars in your city, and you can create a tour around that. Or you were an enthusiastic dater in your early twenties and can show couples the most romantic spots in town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make it quirky, and make it specific. You could create tours especially for the elderly, or for families with kids. Market yourself in relevant places and start walking!</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Sell your photos as a stock photographer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have you always loved photography, and do you have countless pictures that are great—but not really useful for you? Sell them as stock photos! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this will probably <a href="https://www.printful.com/sell-art-online">start out as a small side gig</a>, but it&#8217;s nonetheless a lot of fun and gives you some reward for your creative work. You can upload your work on websites like Unsplash or Pexels and start earning money every time someone uses your photo. If things are looking up, you can even become more independent and start your own website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the amount of content that is being created every, well, minute, there&#8217;s a huge demand for stock footage, and anyone who frequently has to find that knows the most-used pictures by heart—so give them a fresh set of pictures!</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Dream big, but do bigger</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you can see, there’s a wide variety of options out there if you want to start a business. No matter how niche your passion is, you can turn it into a little more than that, even if it would just be to make a passive income from selling courses about your knitting obsession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re looking to double down on yourself and the opportunities out there nowadays, you’ll probably like this podcast on </span><a href="https://resources.audiense.com/blog/podcast-data-stories-leaders-at-work-gaelle-bertrand"><span style="font-weight: 400">developing yourself by seizing opportunities when they arrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, too. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/797321/us-population-by-generation/">Gen Z makes up 20.35% of the U.S. population</a>, and they’re the most diverse generation in terms of race and ethnicity. Known as the smartphone generation, they’re tech-savvy, avid social media users, and protective of the environment.</p>
<p>These are just some of the facts you should know about Gen Z to be able to understand them and get them excited about your brand. <b>Consulting with a </b><a href="https://www.digitalsilk.com/branding-agency"><b>branding agency</b></a><b> might be a good idea to attract the post-millennial generation, but getting informed first is a must.</b> In this guide, we’ll explain six steps you should take to get Gen Z excited about your brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Appeal To Gen Z By Showing That You Care</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gen Z is a caring generation, with the likes of Greta Tunberg being their voice for nature preservation, and ultimately, saving the planet. <b>Marketing to these teens and adolescents shouldn’t be flashy or flamboyant—they prefer eco-friendly and ethical brands.</b></p>
<p>Treat the planet and your employees with respect and gratitude if you want to grab the attention of Gen Z. Your brand policy should be in line with these attitudes if you want to successfully grab Gen Z’s attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Have A Healthy Purpose</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most businesses focus solely on the numbers and the income they make. That might be fine with some of the older generations, but the Gen Z population isn’t so product or money-oriented. They prefer a brand that has a clear purpose and tries to make the world a better place.</p>
<p><b>If you show initiative to help your community, spread positivity, preserve nature, fight for those less fortunate, and stand up to social injustice, you’ll look good in the eyes of everyone, especially younger generations.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Interact With Them On Multiple Platforms</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gen Z is a very interactive generation, they are native to social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tik Tok, YouTube, Twitter, and more. <b>Responding to your audience through these outlets can increase their interest and gain their loyalty.</b></p>
<p>Younger audiences are brand conscious and gladly flock to brands that are listening and catering to their needs. Loyalty is a two-way street, and you have to build it gradually but remember to maintain it throughout your brand expansion and <a href="https://bid4papers.com/blog/educational-content-for-marketing/">marketing content</a> for future success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Don’t Patronize Or Lie To Gen Z</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being honest is not always easy, but if you want your brand to succeed, you’ll have to be genuine and inspiring. False advertising doesn’t sit well with anyone, but the older generation tends to succumb to it more than the younger ones.</p>
<p><b>Try to be relatable and personalize your communication with the Gen Z audience.</b> It will go a long way if you treat them with respect and be upfront and honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Focus On Mobile Users</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baby boomers might have trouble adjusting to the tech era, but Gen Z is born in it. The majority of this population uses smartphones and tablets as their go-to digital devices. Many brands prioritize the desktop experience, but that shouldn’t be the case anymore.</p>
<p><b>If you want to target younger users, make sure the </b><a href="https://capturly.com/blog/mobile-app-facts-for-a-great-ux/"><b>mobile experience is smooth</b></a><b>, fast, and optimal.</b> Invest the same or higher amounts in the mobile version of your website — don’t necessarily prioritize the desktop experience.</p>
<p>For example, you can hire a <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/website-design-development/illinois/chicago">Chicago web design company</a> to help you out with this, if you’re living in Chicago. There are companies that specialize in this all over the US, and employing industry-leading experts can surely help your brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Cut Straight to the Point—They Have Shorter Attention Spans!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital era brought many benefits to brands across all industries. However, it also brought some flaws to the younger generations — their attention spans are very short, <a href="https://www.iabuk.com/opinions/rise-short-form-video-gen-z-social-revolution">around eight seconds</a>, which is four seconds shorter than the attentions of millennials.</p>
<p>How do you grab someone’s attention in such a short period of time? There are a few schools of thought on this.</p>
<p>First, you need to be creative and employ modern media methods whether using <a href="https://blog.hunchads.com/dynamic-creative">Facebook ads</a> or Instagram feeds to reach your audience. Most people are visual learners and prefer this medium, which also applies to Gen Z.</p>
<p>Second, you can try to offer an incentive for them to sign up for an email list of some sort.  While they’re typically weary of doing this, if you offer the right lead magnet it’s possible to get them signed up.  From there, use an email marketing platform <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-email-marketing-software-services/">from this list</a> to deliver a ton of value over the course of a few weeks and then focus on your “ask”.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Gen Z likes extremely short videos, such as those featured in Instagram Reels or on Tik Tok. <b>Adding these catchy videos to your website, within emails, or even better, reaching out to audiences on these dominant social media platforms, can be the key to grabbing their attention.</b></p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with using these apps, consider <a href="https://www.bookafy.com/what-to-keep-in-mind-when-hiring-gen-z-flexibility-security-balance/">hiring Gen Z</a> influencers to help you out. They can tag and showcase your brand, which is more likely to catch the attention of Gen Z than relying solely on your main website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Parting Advice</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that some of these tips will work better than the others because <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/797321/us-population-by-generation/">Gen Z is a vast population with over 67 million people</a> in the US alone. If you’re considerate and put in the effort to personalize your brand toward Gen Z, you’ll likely get their attention.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many perks to utilizing social media marketing. Facebook being the largest social media platform, presents itself as a prolific marketing base. So why hesitate to use it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Facebook netizens are active participants of the platform. There is no better place to market a business than a platform that spreads the word like woodfire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whopping </span><b>2.91 billion monthly active Facebook users</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is </span><b> 36.7% of the global population</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They will surely help you amass an audience, engage in </span><b>B2C and B2B marketing,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and target a psychographic audience while building a transparent business &amp; customers relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, learn how Facebook marketing helps you develop your business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How Facebook Marketing Helps You</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a Facebook page for your business is similar to having a digital voice; it speaks in favor of your business. In addition, just the sheer number of Facebook users makes it a considerable marketing platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook marketing will help your business grow on a grand scale if you implement it correctly. Here are some aspects on which Facebook marketing will help you succeed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Reaching an Audience</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are well aware that Facebook stands at the top of the social media population ranking. Just the length and versatility of the Facebook population make it one of the best platforms to market your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To many, it may present itself as a chatting and gossiping platform where you usually talk to friends and funny memes. Still, Facebook has the potential to reach the right audience you want your business to target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business may target a particular age group, locality, community, interests, and the versatile facebook citizens will cater for you the right type of audience your business requires. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Facebook Helps In B2B &amp; B2C Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were under the impression that Facebook only offers B2C marketing, let me wipe the linear perception off your eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guess what? Facebook is also an excellent platform for B2B marketing. With an established brand awareness on Facebook business, you can start B2B marketing on Facebook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, with the help of Facebook groups and communities, it is easier to engage a targeted audience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Facebook messenger, you can engage in business conversion with other businesses like yours. The targeting segments offered by Facebook help you with B2B marketing. Here are some examples-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job title.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employer Name.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment industry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest industry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers company size</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook offers countless targeting opportunities to generate leads using Facebook ads. With all its marketing features, Facebook is a Great place for both B2C and B2B marketing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Transparent audience</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook offers your business self-selecting audience targeting, helping you categorize your audience by transparently segmenting them according to user demography. Here is how you can have a transparently familiar audience-</span></p>
<ul>

			<p>Although the advancement of technology has eased the marketing process, growing your business is quite a challenge with such competition in the market.</p>
<p>SaaS marketing consists of its own set of rules, consumers majorly purchase products online. Hence engaging users through online tactics like free trials and demos is necessary.</p>
<p>Coming up with the right SaaS product is the start of building a successful business, which is lined up with a deforming strategy, making use of resources, and more. For example, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/finance/business-process-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.toptal.com/finance/business-process-optimization&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1657603017659000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MH6r3UkweKS_-ZqywT5uO">hiring freelance business process optimization consultants</a> is also one of the things that will ensure your long-term success.</p>
<p>To pitch your product to the right audience and get the maximum conversion, you need to plan a perfect roadmap for your business. In the article below we will be taking you through a few useful ideas to add to your marketing strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Content marketing and SEO</h3>
<p>SEO and content marketing combined are capable of driving immense traffic to your website. Both of these elements should be considered vital elements. Content creation is one of most of the common practices SaaS marketers use for brand awareness and trust.</p>
<p>Simply content marketing means providing information to customers that resolve common errors and pain points of customers.</p>
<p>But just posting articles won’t make much difference in the brand’s visibility and authority until you build site backlinks. Also, guest posting will help increase substantial domain ratings.</p>
<p>Investing in organic traffic is proved to be efficient in SaaS business growth because users appreciate informational content.</p>
<p>As the traffic starts commencing, you get the <a href="https://www.softwareworld.co/top-lead-generation-software/">opportunity to build lead magnets</a>. Convert the coming audience to email subscribers so you conveniently pitch your SaaS product. To go a step further in generating brand credibility, provide ‘free product trials’ to visitors that are reached through content marketing and SEO efforts.</p>
<p>Another approach of content marketing that seems to benefit SaaS marketers is to generate content for middle and bottom funnels. It comprises many aspects from creating knowledge banks to product documentation and use-case pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Google Ads</h3>
<p>SEO and content marketing are great for generating traffic but it can take a while a few months or a year to get the desired results. However, with paid advertisements, it’s possible to gain results from day one.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://www.digivate.com/blog/ppc/benefits-of-ppc/">major benefits of PPC ads</a> is having a scale for driving targeted traffic. Paid ads simplify the planning budget as per your need as you have the idea of results to be gained with an associated price.</p>
<p>Google allows users to leverage a robust advertising platform that comprises diverse audience targeting options. But the CPC bid for software related terms can be</p>
<p>Google has a robust advertising system and granular audience targeting options. However, it too consists of a downside: the bid of CPC-related terms can reach up to 100$ per click.</p>
<p>Of course, you would not like to buy such an amount every time. Below are a few ways that will help you surpass these high bids.</p>
<p>Video ads on Google Display Network will help to expose your brand to the same audience at a minimal price of a search network campaign. This may not get you high conversion but it surely gets you substantial visibility.</p>
<p>With google ads target your competitor audience. It is one of the cost-friendly ways to reach out to the audience who are interested in products similar to your brand’s. To initiate your aim in targeting your best competitor’s domain.</p>
<p>Although paid ads are quick and effective, you will have to try multiple combinations of ads copy, creatives as well as the audience for best results.</p>
<p>Paid advertising can be done on several social networks. We will suggest you choose a lesser-known medium like Quora over popular channels as there is less number of businesses using it. This means you will face less competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Referrals</h3>
<p>If you are concerned about customer growth, referral programs are something that can make a difference. Here are some stats that show how useful it can be for SaaS marketers:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Consumers are four times more likely to purchase a product when it is referred by a friend.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Referred consumers have a <a href="https://www.saasquatch.com/blog/rs-17-referral-marketing-statistics/#:~:text=The%20Lifetime%20Value%20for%20new,have%20become%20easier%20to%20adopt.">16% higher lifetime value</a> compared to non-referred consumers.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.buyapowa.com/blog/92-of-consumers-trust-word-of-mouth/#:~:text=Well%2C%20according%20to%20Nielsen%2C%2092,all%20other%20forms%20of%20advertising.&amp;text=It%20is%20all%20down%20to,than%20a%20person%20you%20know.">92% of the times people trust</a> references coming from someone they know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trust plays an important part in the working of referrals. You too must have at some instant may have looked for social proof, especially with people who know to form a judgment on whether to buy a particular product or service.</p>
<p>Referral programs come in different shapes and forms. Some of the commonly used platforms include full-blown affiliate programs where members earn something for every successful referral they make and the second is offering users an upgrade to the next tiers.</p>
<p>One of the excellent examples of Referral programs is Dropbox. The cloud platform offers users to have extra space every time the user signup using their reference.</p>
<p>This will definitely encourage more people to refer to their site as anyone would be interested in having extra cloud space without paying more. The new sign-ups can also leverage onboarding action for earning more space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Constantly Optimise Your Website Conversion Rate</h3>
<p>For SaaS marketers, the website is a major aspect of their business. It is like a window shop that gives consumers the overlook of companies’ products. Hence you need to build a website that is appealing to viewers and at the same time capable of converting leads.</p>
<p>There are several techniques out there that can boost customer engagement on your website, this includes Free trial sign-ups, software demos, content downloading, and more. Try several techniques till you find the best fit.</p>
<p>You don’t necessarily have to pay a high cost to create gain high conversion. In fact, you can double the conversion by spending a little or no cost at all. To achieve this you have to focus on your website’s conversion rate optimization on your website.</p>
<p>Work on different lead generation activities to efficiently plan your marketing budgets assisting you in obtaining substantial leads through web traffic.</p>
<p>Tips: Run trials before you make any changes or add anything to your site. For instance, before adding a new call to action run it on each website page to check how much traction it can achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Partner marketing</h3>
<p>When you collaborate with a potential SaaS business you get the opportunity to maximize your consumers. It also allows both the parties to leverage each other’s strength and get the right support in required situations.</p>
<p>To get the right results from partner marketing, you need to choose the right partner. Look for a partner that resembles your business values, goals and audience and hold expertise in certain things which you don’t.</p>
<p>However, don’t go for partners that are your direct competitor. It is also important to check whether working with partners is easy or enjoyable. If you face many difficulties in working or communicating with them it will not be much good for any of you.</p>
<p>There are various forms of partner marketing. here are some of the effective ideas you can make use of after you agree on the terms:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Promote each other’s business through email lists or social channels.</b></li>

<li aria-level="1"><b>Both companies can collab to build a new product</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Jointly create forums on topics of mutual interest</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Publish a guest post on partner&#8217;s blogs</b></li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what forms you include in your partner marketing, both you and the partnering company must be clear on ‘<b>what outcoming goals</b>’ to expect. Plan a partnership deal that parts growth or substantial benefits to both businesses. A well-established partnership brings out the best results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
