										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Job opportunities are hard to come by nowadays with the ongoing pandemic, and to be honest, you’d rather find a way that you can work at home to limit your risks. There are tons of work opportunities available that can be done 100% remotely. Here is a list of six</span><a href="https://searchremotely.com/remote-jobs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">remote job opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you may not have considered.</span>

You need some severe problem-solving skills, so that you can master <a href="https://getvoip.com/blog/first-call-resolution/">first caller resolution</a>. </span>
<h2><b>SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media managers should expect a 10% growth in their fields for the next 10 years, which means this career option is a great pick as there are no signs of it slowing down anytime soon. For those who have a background in copywriting or advertising, this could turn out to be the perfect fit. You get to enjoy doing the same or similar work that you used to do at the office, but this time, you are doing it without having to rise early in the morning, sit in traffic for endless amounts of hours, and then pay a monthly fee for your parking. Working at home allows you to save money that you otherwise would have spent on all of the expenses getting to work costs in the first place. There are several </span><a href="https://www.milanote.com/templates/marketing/social-media-calendar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media calendars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help you get organized at home.  </span>
<h2><b>REMOTE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the current climate of the world, the rehabilitation sciences are going remote. Qualified and licensed speech therapists can find remote work online where they can continue serving the needs of patients dealing with speech limitations.</span>
<h2><b>WEB DEVELOPER</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development is another fantastic field to get into if you are not already familiar with and working in this career.

It’s possible to be job-ready after three to six months of self-study. Salaries can start as high as $60,000, which makes this a very popular option for people looking to break into the work-at-home crowd.</span>
<h2><b>REMOTE HR MANAGER</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote opportunities are also available for trained human resource professionals. When people think of remote </span><a href="https://lifewithkrich.com/work-from-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work done from home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, human resources generally doesn’t cross their minds, but it is something that can be done, and plenty of companies are hiring.</span>
<h2><b>TRANSCRIPTIONIST</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever seen those ads saying, “Work at home in data entry? Just pay $25, and we’ll tell you how.” Yes, those are sadly scams. You should never pay any money for working at home. But there is an opportunity available for people who want a typing job they can do from home. Transcription is typing what you hear from audio files. It’s easy to get started, and opportunities are plentiful. All you need is a computer and a transcription audio player that you can download for free, and that’s it. Salaries are decent, paying anywhere from $10 to $30 plus an hour.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like it’s impossible to find a decent job that you can do from home, but this is not the case. It is easier than it has ever been. You just need to know where to look.</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/remote-work-opportunities-for-you/">Remote Work Opportunities For You</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, Instagram has offered two types of posts on its platform. The first type is the usual post that anyone with an Instagram account can create. The other form is paid or sponsored posts called <em><strong>Instagram ads</strong></em> that run on Facebook&#8217;s well-known advertising platform. These posts offer a unique kind of opportunity that all businesses with an online presence should tightly grip. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like <a href="https://digiperform.com/use-facebook-ads-generate-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook ads</a>, Instagram ads are very different from regular posts on the platform and to properly execute Instagram marketing strategy you will need to know what you are getting into.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following lines, we will guide you through the mist that surrounds advertising on Instagram and we will provide you with all the information you may need to get started. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the complete beginner&#8217;s guide to Instagram Advertising or guide for Instagram ads, we will share tips and advice from our own experience with the platform.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>For Starters, What Are Instagram Ads?</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads on Instagram are paid posts and a hugely effective marketing tool that lets companies and brands reach directly to a very specific target group. You have probably browsed your feed and encountered posts that are marked as “<strong>Sponsored</strong>” by companies that you do not follow. That&#8217;s exactly what an Instagram ad is.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-advertising.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><img class=" wp-image-24368 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-advertising.jpg" alt="instagram advertising" width="607" height="337" /></b></a>
<b>The main advantage of advertising on Instagram is that you have control over exactly what the post will look like, but above all who the post will appear for.</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you are able to choose a goal for each ad so that you can easily achieve exactly the results you are looking for. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you probably understand, this is a great way to increase your brand&#8217;s publicity while reaching a very specific target audience on one of the world&#8217;s highest converting marketing platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those brands that are successful at mastering ads on Instagram, it is just the imagination that limits what they can achieve and if you want to stick out from the rest with your marketing strategy there needs to be a lot of work involved.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>How Do Instagram Ads Work?</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get started with our detailed step-by-step guide to advertising on Instagram, you would like to share some background information. </span>
<strong><em>First, it is important that you understand that Instagram does not have its own advertising platform without sharing it with Facebook. </em></strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, you will manage your ads through <strong>Facebook Ads Manager</strong> and all you need is an account on both Instagram and Facebook. We understand that it may seem complicated at first glance but the fact is that it is very practical, especially since you don&#8217;t have to learn how to manage two different advertising platforms.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Facebook-Ads-Manager-platform.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24369" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Facebook-Ads-Manager-platform.jpg" alt="Facebook-Ads-Manager-platform" width="1920" height="1080" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also prepare yourself for creating the entire ad campaign and adjusting all settings to suit your imagined specifications including who it is you want to target, what your goal is, how long you want to advertise, and so on. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, you need to create the content you want to share and it is therefore important that you have a plan before you start. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But don&#8217;t worry since we will go into more detail about planning soon and Facebook&#8217;s command center is easy to use. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, it’s not hard to get started with your first Instagram ad and with the help of the guide below you will start advertising as a professional before you know it.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A Step-By-Step Guide to Advertising on Instagram</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Ads Manager is a practical and innovative tool that facilitates the work of marketers around the world, although all features and settings can sometimes be perceived as messy by beginners. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of it is that you can finish the process with five relatively easy steps. Here are the steps on how to create Instagram ads:</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>1. Open Ad Manager</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to log in to Instagram and open Facebook Ad Manager. Make sure you are logged in to the correct accounts and that your Facebook account is linked to the Instagram account on which you want to run the ad. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is by any chance your first time using the platform, we suggest you take a moment to look at the interface and the various features offered.</span>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>2. Choose a Goal</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second and possibly most important step is to choose why you want to advertise. Instagram offers a list of different goals and your choice here will influence how the ad looks and works later.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose the following goals:</span>
<h4><b>Brand awareness &#8211;</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This goal was developed for people who want to spread their brand to newly engaged customers. The algorithm behind the process is still unknown but it is an effective tool and one of the most popular choices.</span>
<h4><b>Reach &#8211;</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you only want to reach more potential customers then this is all you need. Simple, effective and practical.</span>
<h4><b>Traffic &#8211;</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This choice is also very popular and perfect for anyone who wants to drive more traffic to a website or online store with the goal of encouraging sales. In other words, the goal is for brands that want to increase their sales or boost the number of downloaded apps, for example.</span>
<h4><b>Engagement &#8211;</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many brands use advertising on Instagram to improve engagement levels in their accounts and this is the goal. If you choose to engage with your ad, Instagram will help you get as many likes, comments, and shares as possible.</span>
<h4><b>App Installs &#8211;</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that want to run app installs have two choices. Either you choose traffic as we mentioned above or you take it a step further and choose app installation. Note that your app must be available in one of the app stores for this feature to work.</span>
<h4><b>Video views</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This goal is obvious: if you have a video you want to distribute, this is the best solution.</span>
<h4><b>Lead Generation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting more leads and potential customers is essential for any company that wants to grow. If you are a broker, lifestyle coach or just looking for new customers, an Instagram ad with the goal of Lead Generation can be just what you need. Just be aware that Instagram&#8217;s lead generation is not as well-developed as Facebook&#8217;s; at least not yet.</span>
<h4><b>Conversions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspire people to take a precise action on your business&#8217;s site, such as having them to add items to a cart, download your app, register for your site, or make a purchase.</span>
<h4><b>Catalog Sales</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Display products from your eCommerce store&#8217;s catalog to generate sales.</span>
<h4><b>Store Traffic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote your traditional street-based business locations to people that are nearby.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>3. Specify your target audience</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important thing to succeed with Instagram ads is that you know your target audience. This is what your entire ad will rest on and without enough information, your ad will be so nonspecific that it will not even reach your customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process itself is similar to the one used for Facebook ads and here you can, for example, choose where your target group lives and add more specific requirements such as life events, education, a form of living, etc.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>4. Customize the placement</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plan to advertise only on Instagram, you have two choices regarding placement, feed or story. The story format is slightly more limited than ads that appear in the user&#8217;s regular feed, but the two formats offer different benefits. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to run the same ad on both Facebook and Instagram you have the opportunity to choose this. Remember that Facebook&#8217;s preset settings are set so that all ads are published on both Facebook and Instagram by default, so if you just want to post on Instagram you have to change the settings in this step.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>5. Decide on budget and duration before pressing publish</strong></span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you have your content planned, the final step is to decide on a budget and how long the ad should be active. At first, this step is the most difficult for many and we advise you not to stress. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it may be good to know that you have the opportunity to adjust your budget and duration even after the ad is live. Although it is always good to have a plan for what you expect to spend and we offer more tips on this matter further down.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, the process itself is relatively simple and you only have two choices: budget and length. And that was it. After making the final settings, you will be redirected to a page where you can upload your content, write a caption, add call-to-action buttons and finally publish the ad.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>It’s Time To Think About Before Your First AD on Instagram</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you should have a better idea of what it takes to advertise on Instagram and hopefully, you agree that it doesn&#8217;t seem too difficult. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also expect to get better and faster at planning and publishing ads the more times you do it. Although if you&#8217;re preparing for your first Instagram ad, there are a few things you should plan and think about before you even get started.</span>
<h2><strong>What Kind of Content Suits You?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram today offers a couple of different types of content formats for ads. The two most common and most commonly used are the <strong>traditional image</strong> and <strong>video formats</strong> that are similar to regular posts on Instagram though with the ability to add call-to-action such as <strong>Contact Us</strong>, <strong>Book Now</strong>, <strong>Download</strong>, <strong>Show Now</strong> and so on. You also have the option of choosing a carousel version where you can upload multiple images and let users browse through them on their own. </span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_2019-10-03-15-02-41-177-1.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24370 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_2019-10-03-15-02-41-177-1.jpeg" alt="Shop Now call to action" width="340" height="604" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We would also like to add that more and more businesses choose to advertise in the immensely popular Story format even though it is more restrictive than the aforementioned formats. For example, you do not have access to the same number of goals and call-to-action opportunities.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, Instagram has developed a new and customizable format that only supports mobile devices. The format is called Canvas ads and offers almost infinite settings. Due to the technical characteristics of the format, we advise beginners to wait until they have a better look at the simpler formats.</span>

<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>What Does Your Budget Look Like?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many brands are unsure how big their budget should be for the ads, but there is nothing you need to spend too much time on. You probably have an available budget and by comparing it to how long you want to advertise, you can quickly figure out what you can spend per day. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good rule of thumb for beginners is to start low and then increase the budget if needed. If you want to advertise over a weekend, <strong>40 &#8211; 60$</strong> can be good enough for the entire period and as for longer ads, a <strong>20-30$</strong> a day is usually appropriate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as I said, it&#8217;s up to you to test and see what works best for your particular needs as it usually takes a few tries before you get to the perfect budget.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>What Does Your Target Audience Look Like?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that we have already mentioned this a couple of times but it is so very important to get it right on the target group that we have to mention it again. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides being good at knowing who your target audience consists of, it&#8217;s also the only way for Instagram (Facebook) to know who it is you want to reach and why or if you&#8217;re not clear enough, your ad will reach out to people who have no interest in what you have to offer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it is different to target your ad to middle-aged small business owners with a university education and home loan than it is to target 20-year-old girls with an interest in beauty products.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our point is that what requires the most careful planning for an ad is your target audience and once you hit the nail on the head you can expect amazing results.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>A Few Last Important Tips</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we send you off so you can start planning your next Instagram ad, we have a few tips to keep in mind.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, you need to emphasize using only high quality and relevant content. The same rules apply to ads as for regular Instagram posts and the focus is always on images and videos; so you don&#8217;t have to focus too much on the other parts of your ad. Many times, a well-produced image or video with a sentence or two gives the magic results.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, you may want to consider using hashtags, but there is no constraint since your ad will already be targeted, some people believe that hashtags can have the opposite effect on ads so be careful. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most ad formats on Instagram allow you to use 30 hashtags but try not to fill the entire quota. Instead, 3-5 smart hashtags can give your ad extra impact.</span>

<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we advise you to take it easy and calmly. It will take work and several attempts before you get your first really good Instagram ad, but it&#8217;s something you get better and better at. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it doesn&#8217;t have to feel hopeless if your first advertising on Instagram did not go as planned since that means that you just have to try again. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as you have a plan and know your target audience, you have every opportunity in the world to take advantage of Instagram&#8217;s innovative advertising system.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is basic but the most important aspect of online marketing. This <em>free beginner&#8217;s guide to SEO marketing</em> will help you learn and understand how to employ SEO in your digital marketing strategy.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What Is SEO?</b></span></h2>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/seo-creative.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23659 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/seo-creative.png" alt="What is seo?" width="409" height="327" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO stands for “<em>Search Engine Optimization</em>”. It is a practice of increasing traffic to your website and providing exposure to your brand through Search Engine Results that are not paid for (also known as “organic results”). </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A well planned and executed SEO strategy helps your website rank higher in the search results thus bringing a lot of quality traffic.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To derive at the best suitable SEO strategy for your business, you need to take into consideration the following questions,</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the people searching for online?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What answers they are seeking?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What words they are using to search?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of content do they wish to consume?</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, knowing what the users want is just one face of SEO coin and presenting it in such a way that search engines find easy to crawl and understand is other.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Importance of SEO</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">42% of people all over the world use the internet and this number is increasing as you read this. This point to the fact that there is huge traffic online which can prove powerful for a business. Along with the quantity, there is a lot of very specific and high intent traffic.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid advertising, social media and other online mediums can generate traffic to websites but the quantity of traffic driven by search engines is unmatched for. Organic search results cover a vast area of the digital canvas and receive way more clicks.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People are searching for many things directly related to your business. However, many people searching for information loosely related to the business. This is a huge opportunity to connect with those folks, help them with the answers and thus become a trusted resource for them. There are more chances that people will use the services/products from the business they trust.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO when setting up correctly will continue to provide results over long periods. Thus, SEO is the essence of any digital marketing strategy.</span>
<h4><b>On-Page vs. Off-Page SEO</b></h4>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/off-page-on-page-seo.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23660 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/off-page-on-page-seo.png" alt="off page on page seo" width="736" height="339" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you launch a business online, your website is the online property you own. It is totally in your control of how the optimization will take place on the website. Search engines look at two important aspects when evaluating your website – </span>On-Page and Off-Page SEO.
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>On-Page SEO</strong> (also known as “On-Site SEO”) lets you convey what your site is about. It a practice of optimizing different parts of the website that directly affect the website’s ranking on the search engines. The most important factors include Title tags, Header tags, Alt text for images, page loading speed, internal linking and Page content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Off-Page</strong> or Off-Site SEO is all about increasing the domain authority. This is achieved by getting links from other relevant authority websites in your niche. Backlinks pointing to your website is the most important off-page factor which establishes your authority among other sites. This is a signal for search engines to endorse your site as a trusted resource for the people seeking answers.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>White Hat and Black Hat SEO</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“<em>White Hat SEO</em>” refers to the SEO techniques, strategies and methods that follow the Search engine guidelines and rules. Playing by these rules might take some time to give you the results but once you are through with it, the results work for you in the long run.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, “<em>Black Hat SEO</em>” refers to those techniques that attempt to trick the search engines to rank higher in the search results. While the spammy techniques can work, it possesses a tremendous risk of getting penalized or the website being de-indexed (removed from search results) completely. </span>

<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Keyword Research</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have learned what is SEO, let us look at how, to begin with, the process of generating a strategy for your website’s SEO.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword research is the first and the most important step in that direction. In simple words, <em><strong>keywords are those terms that people will search for on the search engines to seek answers.</strong></em></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any business becomes successful by providing people with the information, products, and services they need. Keyword research will present you with opportunities to better understand the right kind audience for your business. It will help you answer questions like,</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are people searching for?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many people are searching for it?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of information they are seeking?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h4><b>Discovering Keywords and Search Volume  </b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a few keywords in mind which you’d like to rank for, that’s great! These could be the products or services you offer. These are the seed keywords to kick off the research process in the right direction. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter these keywords into the Keyword Research tools to get insight into the search volume and related keywords. The related keywords can give you an idea about the keyword variations.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s consider an example of a clothing brand which deals in sportswear.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you type in “sports” and “Clothing” in the research tool, you may discover highly relevant and highly searched keywords such as,</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimming trunks</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gym shorts</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track pants</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While you discover keywords, you may notice the search volume varies greatly. Though you definitely could go with highly searched keywords, the competition is also high. Also, keywords with low search volume are advantageous as they have less competition and covert quickly.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both high and low search volume keywords can be advantageous. Looking at the search volumes, you are at a better position to decide which keywords to prioritize that will give your website the biggest strategic advantage.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h4><b>Focus on Long-Tail Keywords</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, the search queries that people put in the search engines can often be of three types – Informational, Navigational, and Transactional. These are categorized based on the intent with which the user is searching on the web. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Informational queries constitute a situation where the user needs some information such as “how long is the river Nile” or “what is the population of India”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the user wishes to go to a certain website, like say “YouTube”, it falls into the navigational queries. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this section, we will focus on the third category, the transactional queries. This constitutes the buying phase where the users have already researched for the products/services they are interested in and is ready to buy or make a transaction. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-tail keywords are very specific three to four words phrases that users search for with the intent of buying the products or services you offer. Most of the time, these specific searches will result in sales than generic searches that tend to be towards the research phase before making a buying decision.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, even if the search volume of the generic queries is 10000 a month, it is only a fraction of all the searches performed on the internet. Keywords with a very high search volume may present users with ambiguous content. However, Low volume and very specific keywords present users with exactly what they need and help you to convert them.</span>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>On-page SEO</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have discovered, prioritized and decided the keywords your target market is searching for, it is the time to use those keywords in the web pages on the website. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best practice would be to optimize the content on each of the web pages, focusing on a particular keyword, as every keyword has a different intent and answers for your website visitors.</span>
<h3><b>Title Tags</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Title tags are the HTML element that is descriptive and specifies the title of the webpage. Each of the web page on the website should have a unique title tag. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the first thing visible to the users on the search engines. Title tags are important as it casts the first impression on the users.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate recipe for the title tags include,</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Keyword usage</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In practice, the target keywords should be at the start of the Title. This helps the search engines and users to understand what the page is all about. </span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Length</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, search engines show <strong>50 to 60</strong> characters of the title in the search results. However, do not limit the title to the strict character count if hampers the readability.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Branding</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a brand, it is a good means to fuel the brand awareness effort. Including the brand name at the end of the title make people acquainted with your brand and increases the click-through rate if it is a well-known brand.</span>
<h3><a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-07-at-6.10.55-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-23666 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-07-at-6.10.55-PM.png" alt="On Page And Off Page SEO" width="584" height="566" /></a></h3>
<h4><b>Meta Descriptions</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta-description plays a very important role in the strategy. It’s an opportunity to write a description that summarizes the title. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Good Meta-description increases the chances of the user clicking and visiting your business. The more the CTR (Click-through rate), the greater the chance of the people using services or buying products that you offer.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said since search engines display first <strong>150 &#8211; 166</strong> characters of the description, it is advisable to keep it under that limit. Also, include your target keywords in the Meta description to give it more value from users’ and search engine’s perspective.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Content</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual content on a web page is what provides value by answering the user’s questions. It is important as different types of content have different roles to play. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, a web page with content for SEO strategies will help users in a certain way than a web page with customer care related content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While you create the content, it is advisable to refrain from using low-value tactics such as,</span>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Thin and Duplicate content</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a piece of content on a web page, there is no magic number for word count. The most important factor to consider is to account for the intent behind creating that web page. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just incorporating the keywords and writing a very short content won’t work. Search engines today give more weight to relevance for the users than themselves. So, creating the content just for search engines by ignoring user questions will land you in trouble.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, duplicating the content on multiple web pages is not advisable. For example, suppose you have a website for sportswear. You have created two web pages for “swimming costume” and “swimming trunks”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the web pages are optimized for different keywords, the content will essentially be the same. Tactics like these are not helpful for the user, and as Google specifically stresses on this factor, you could be penalized.</span>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Cloaking</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloaking is a practice of presenting users and search engines with different content. According to the search engine’s guidelines, the content on the website should be visible to both the users and the search engines alike. Websites do this by hiding the text in HTML just for the sake of search engines and the users are not able to see this content.</span>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4><b>Keyword Stuffing</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inserting a large number of keywords in the web content and Meta description to rank higher in the search results is termed as keyword stuffing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This could be done in many ways, such as matching the font color to the background, setting font size to zero and hiding the keywords behind an image. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is an unethical SEO technique and if caught your website could be penalized and de-indexed from the search results. Moreover, any users visiting your site will not stay for long due to the absence of relevant content.</span>
<h4></h4>
<h4><b>Alt Text</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alt text is an HTML element that provides alternative text to the images on a web page. This image markup technique can not only impact the way search engines perceive your web page but it also helps you to generate traffic from an image search on the search engines. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It increases web accessibility as search engine crawlers are not able to crawl the images (.jpeg, .png, etc.) on a web page. Providing Alt text also helps visually impaired people to understand what the image depicts through the screen readers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The important point to note here is that you should not stuff keywords while providing the alt text as it hampers the relevance of images for search engines.</span>
<h4></h4>
<h4><b>URL Structure</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">URL stands for “uniform resource locator”. Every web page on the website has a unique address known as a URL. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the most direct way for someone to visit a page on the website. As the title and Meta description, the URL is also shown in the search engine results. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A URL mentioning a clear path to the web page is helpful for the users who are trying to understand what a specific URL is all about. Consider a website which sells dessert. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be individual web pages for say “apple pie” and “fruit custard”. In this case, the best URL structure would be “example.com/dessert/apple-pie” and “example.com/dessert/fruit-custard”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, if someone is looking to buy fruit custard, the user is in a better position to click the related URL.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Information Architecture and the Power of Links</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Information architecture is a concept of how you organize different pages on your website. In response to the searches performed on the search engines, the way pages are organized and inter-linked on the website has a tremendous impact.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With well-planned information architecture, search engines can better understand what a page is about and how important it is. Search engines perceive links as the “votes of confidence”.</span>
<h4><b>Internal Links</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal linking is a practice of linking different pages of the same domain. In layman’s term, an internal link is one that points to another page on the same website. Internal links are useful for three main reasons,</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They allow users to navigate a website in the best possible way.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They help to establish information hierarchy for the given website.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They help search engines to spread link juice among websites. Consider a website that deals with car performance chips. External domains link to a particular page on the website providing information on how the performance chips work. The other page on the website is sales-related which receive comparatively less number of external links. Now, if the informative page links to the sales-related page, it is a signal to the search engines that the sales page has authority because it is linked to the page with more authority.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4><b>External Links</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as inbound links or backlinks are HTML hyperlinks that point from one website to another. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinks are the currency of the internet. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you visit a town and you ask three people what the best restaurant in that town was, and they all said, “Nanking”, you’ll feel confident that it indeed is the best restaurant. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is exactly what backlinks do for the search engines. If a good quality of links points to your website, search engines know that your website is authoritative and it helps to improve the rank of the website in the search results. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The simplistic step-by-step way to build backlinks to your website,</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct audience research and study about the audience in your niche.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a list of websites which are related to your niche and appeal to your audience.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore the type of information the audience on these sites wishes to consume.</span></li>

<h4><b>Follow and No-follow Links</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To give you an idea of how powerful the links are, when a web page gets an inbound link, which is a hyperlink pointing to that page from another website, it helps to boost the SEO. Consider a link as one point (Link juice), the more points you get the more it is beneficial to rank higher.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have learned how external links work, we can define the follow and no-follow links. Follow links are those links that pass the link juice to the website they are pointing to. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No-follow links, on the other hand, does not pass the link juice. No-follow links tell the search engines not to follow the links. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some search engines still follow the “no-follow” links to simply discover new pages but does not contribute towards boosting the SEO.</span>
<h2><b> </b></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Additional SEO Parameters</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main factor for ranking higher in the search results in SEO has been link building until now. With time, as the search engines are becoming more intelligent, they have started to give importance to a lot of small but important parameters. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically, the strategies for SEO differ for different businesses. But, there are some common factors everyone should pay attention to. These common factors include,</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Page Speed</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple words, users’ interest to remain on a page is inversely proportional to the page load time. The lesser the time your page takes to load the more probability of people spending more time on the website. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies reveal that 53% of people will leave a mobile page if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. Optimizing the page for speed includes identifying and optimizing the elements that take more time to load due to their size.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Mobile Friendliness</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, websites are experiencing most of the traffic from mobile devices. Since traffic from mobile devices outweighs the traffic from desktop, how ‘mobile-friendly’ your website is will have a huge effect on the website ranking. </span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>XML Sitemap</b></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">XML sitemaps help search engines understand your site and find all of its content. Submitting a page to the search engines in the sitemap does not mean that your page will rank in the search results. Consider it as a door to your site where search engines can decide for how to rank that page. You can create your own <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google XML sitemap online</a> as well. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>In Conclusion</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulate! Yourself for getting this far. Now, with our free beginner&#8217;s guide to SEO marketing, you have learned how search engines rank websites and the techniques that help you rank higher in the search results.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, no site can do a perfect job of executing all the aspects of SEO. “Jack of all trades and master of none” goes for SEO too. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify and prioritize the strengths of your site and use the budget optimally. Plan your SEO strategy in such a way that it gives you the best return on the investment. </span>

However, it&#8217;s difficult to prove its worth to return on investment (ROI).</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although tough to measure and tie directly to revenue, you can track your progress by looking at:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social shares and following</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog views</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct website traffic</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning website visitors</span></li>

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Audience Engagement</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you accomplish building brand awareness, the next step you make to engage your audience with informational as well as problem-solving content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While brand awareness helps you to make your audience aware of your brand and get familiar with your product &amp; services; it also helps them to understand your brand better.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever your audience engages, you can make analysis of what they like or what they don’t; their biggest challenges and what they want to know from you. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to find out like:  </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media shares, likes, and comments</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comments on blogs</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA (click-through rates)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing page conversion rates</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heat maps and clicks patterns</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website bounce rate</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time spent on page</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website page views</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Drive Website Traffic</b></span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In content marketing goals, increasing website traffic is more focused on pushing traffic into the top level of the marketing funnel that ultimately helps to restore the ROI. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To see whether your content is effective at driving traffic to your website, look at the following metrics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique visits (overview and breakdown by channel)</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword rankings</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New vs. returning visitors</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing blog traffic is another content marketing goal which is part of gaining web traffic. To track the progress toward this goal, all you need is to measure:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog visits per month</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword rankings</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social shares</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Lead Generation</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 85% of the marketers around the world believe that lead generation is the ultimate goal for any business success to measure ROI. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder, they try their heart and soul to convert their audience and generate the lead accordingly. To measure how well your content is working for lead generation, you’ll want to track these metrics:</span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leads generated per month</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Search Engine Visibility</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we already have read before in beginner’s guide to content marketing, SEO plays a big role in generating the right traffic for your website. Getting your content rank on top of the first page Google search engine is always a dream goal for any content marketer. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To track your content progress as per SEO strategy, be sure to look at your keyword rankings at least once per quarter, but we suggest pulling reports once per month. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other metrics that you need to track along with SEO:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website traffic from organic search</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Topic clusters</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the same, you can use various SEO tools and generate your content according to the latest <a href="https://digiperform.com/google-seo-updates-the-past-present-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google SEO updates</a>.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Sales</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, fighting for all the great marketing goals and tracking them each month or quarterly; few marketers/businessmen understand the language of Sales only. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing is a valuable tool for moving leads through the inbound marketing funnel and turning visitors into leads and leads into customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To track your success in using the content for sales, monitor these metrics:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead to customer conversion rate (overall and by content piece)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales conversion rates</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length of your sales cycle</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contract size</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost per lead</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Retention and Upsells</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, retaining your audience and upselling them again. This is the most difficult but mandatory goal of content marketing to improve retention and driving upsell. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But creating for your personas shouldn’t end just because someone becomes a customer. Instead, now is the time for you to delight your customers and make them a “</span><b>Happy Customer Forever</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your customer is happy with your product or services, there are 100 percent chances he/she would recommend your business to other people. This is the time when we can’t ignore our happy customers. They are likely to trust you, would love to make more purchases and drive more revenue through upsells. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few metrics to track toward this goal:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer retention rate</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percentage of repeat customers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue from upsells</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Is there any formula to calculate content marketing ROI?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take a simple calculative way to measure the content marketing ROI from <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convince and Convert</a>:</span>
<span style="color: #993300;"><b><i>“Return minus investment, divided by investment, expressed as a percentage”.</i></b></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example,</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone has spent $500 on creating a piece of content, and receiving leads worth $2000, then your ROI is 300%:</span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$2000-$500 = $1500</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">$1500/$500 = 3</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">3 x 100% = 300%</span>
&nbsp;
<h4><b>Conclusion:</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it’s difficult to show how content marketing is performing and generate ROI, these metrics can give you a better sense of performance and how your content is helping with the goals.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By putting the right content with the right tactics, you will be able to generate more traffic, lead and sales to please your businesses or bosses. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, content marketing is worth an investment.</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost motive of any content marketing strategy is to captivate the target audience, educate them and convert them into customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, no wonder, all the content creators give their heart and soul to create such kind of unique and valuable content that definitely helps businesses to achieve their end goals. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kudos to all the content creators!</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, who has less idea what is content marketing all about, we are here to help. </span>
<b>How?</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-the-free-beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free beginner’s guide to content marketing</a>, we have been sharing basic elements related to content marketing, especially for beginners. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, we have shared:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How content marketing plays an important role in a business success? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various ways to create a content marketing strategy? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is content marketing related to marketing funnel? </span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the various tools that can help you generate effective content for the same?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all these efforts won’t give desired results if none of these have appropriate Call-to-Action (CTA) triggers. Yes, you have read right!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, if your motive to share the content is to bring visitors to the website, then you will use a trigger (CTA) to land your audience to your websites. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Same way, whenever you receive an email stating any shopping sale, you might have noticed </span><b>Call-to-Action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing to the website or app. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These action buttons help target audience to land upon the right designated path and give you the successful campaign. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this chapter of beginner’s guide to content marketing, we will be sharing how Call-to-Actions play an important role in any content marketing success. What are the basic steps you need to keep in mind while creating the content? How to create a compelling call-to-action for your content marketing strategy?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19066 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/call-to-actions.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="254" /></span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have stated earlier, Call-to-action helps to captivate the target audience as well as increase the conversions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not all the call-to-action can give you the success rate.  Most of the content marketers aren’t using effective CTAs to target the ideal audience and convert them as happy customers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look into business website stats, only 30% of businesses are using appropriate CTAs to engage their ideal customers. Rest, 70% of business sites lack call-to-action. This is devastating. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our content creators aka marketers need to understand the importance of CTAs in their marketing strategy and how they (CTAs) help them to increase their open as well as success rate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging a prospect to take desired actions as per your marketing strategy may seem the hardest task for marketers, but is not unachievable. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to create informative content for your readers that can solve their problems and serve your purpose. You need to focus on creating a beautiful attractive content design and more &amp; more powerful as well as compelling Call-to-Action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers look for easy and understandable </span><b>Clickable Button</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than a confusing action. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are CTAs?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call-to-Action</a> which are the clickable buttons basically used on your website, landing pages, emails, blogs, etc to guide your readers or visitors towards your goal conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the part of your content that the user needs to click in order to take the action you want them to take.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the question comes, why marketers fail to convert readers to customers. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does wrong in creating a compelling call to action? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What goes into a strong CTA? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the basic things you need to keep in mind while creating an effective CTA for your marketing strategy?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s read further: </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Choose a Goal:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, decide why you need to CTA and what are your purpose to use the following CTA? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should your call to action button is to generate webinar sign-ups or you want your readers to download the ebook? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your audience to share your content or want to land up to your website? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason can be any…..</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, decide your goal and write your appropriate CTA based on your content strategy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, of course, use the desired actionable link so that the reader can the desired action with minimal hassle.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-19069 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ctaa.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="399" />
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Consider the Context:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the place of your reader or prospect in the current marketing cycle. Does your reader knows about your product already or it’s the first time that you have introduced your services to them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it won’t make a sense if your reader is landing for the first time on your homepage to get a CTA about buying an expensive product. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, understand the level and accordingly set your CTA. For example, if you are selling some audio product, in such case, use CTA as “Request a Demo” or “Learn More” instead of using “Buy Now”.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-19070 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/calltoaction-example.png" alt="" width="575" height="362" />
&nbsp;
<h2><b><span style="color: #993300;">Make to Short &amp; Precise:</span> </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember on the golden rule of using CTAs. Using multiple calls to actions buttons in one piece of content can ruin the whole information, lower your conversion rate and confuse your readers as well. Also, wordy CTAs can get easily ignored. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use short and precise CTAs to make your content more effective. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days our readers are more knowledgeable and understand that a hyperlink or button is intended to click. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, Instead of guiding them saying “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here to register for our free webinar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”; use or state “</span><b><i>Register for our free webinar</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which is likely to have a stronger impact.</span>
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-19071 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/with-date-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="279" />
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Place CTA Strategically:</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While creating valuable content, the marketer should know where to place the CTA in the content. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always recommended not to use CTA in the middle of your content, that probably will confuse your readers and distract them from your valuable content.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always place a call to action at the end of the content body when the message of your content is delivered. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2></h2>
<h1><b>How to create a compelling call to action?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content creators invest a lot of time in generating problem-solving content for their readers or give ultimate efforts into your online marketing strategy, but they forget to give focus on research of appropriate Call-to-Actions which led to less conversion. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are getting traffic on your content but no conversions, then this is the high time to look into your “How to club perfect CTA in the content” strategy. </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are few tips to create a compelling call to action for your content.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Direct</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop looking for indirect ways to convert your audience. State clearly what is the purpose of sharing the content. Stop beating around the bush.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your content / your website / your business is valuable that should be in direct in approach. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be precise and tell your visitors what you do and what exactly you would like them to do.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Call to Action must be simple, short and strong.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure there is no room to play guessing games for your visitors or readers to get confused or clueless. Use straightforward examples in a positive way like ‘get started,’ ‘sign up,’ ‘submit,’ or ‘download’.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Unique</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a marketer, you already aware how it is crucial to be unique and stand different in the crowd if you want to beat the competition. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find something that makes your call-to-action special; it could be ridiculously simple or something that aggravates a problem.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Use Actionable Language</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use action words that compel or motivate your visitors to do what you want them to. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, “</span><b><i>Call us today for a free sample</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” will make them curious to have or try at least Free sample which seems a good call to take an action. You are giving clear direction to the reader using the action-  “Call”.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other ways, you can say like “Give us a call for a free demo”  but it seems less actionable then previous one. </span>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be Urgent</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CTAs you use in your content must create the urgency so that visitors take the action. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The agenda is to convey the message that your readers are missing out the great opportunity that should be theirs. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like one example we have used earlier. “Call us today for a free sample” denoted more urgency instead of “Give us a call for a free demo”. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Call us today create the urgency that they can miss out the great deal to use the free sample or demo than later one stating or requesting to give a call for the free demo. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both have a slight difference but the way you approach matter a lot in your CTAs. While “today” is a good word to add in your call to action, using “now” or “immediately” is even better. These words imply a greater urgency and also make it clear that the offer may not last forever.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Call-to-Action Example</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Netflix</b></span></h2>
<b>CTA Button: Join Free for a Month</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are a marketer or entrepreneur, you should know these basics if you want your business at top notch. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we go!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a content creator,  you may think or likely convinced that you know about your target audience inside and out. However, how often as a marketer you thought and do your data based audience research? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the answer is “</span><b><i>rarely</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “</span><b><i>no</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, that you need to deeply figure out how deeply you can work it out to club this as the “must to-do-task” into your to-do list to determine the cross-channel audience. This will not only nurture your knowledge while creating content, but it will also help you to make content marketing efforts successful. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Things To Keep In Mind While Identifying Your Audience</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Social Media, Audiences and Content Marketing &#8211; All are connected</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create </span><b>content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the help of content marketing tools, you share your content through </span><b>social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach out maximum active </span><b>audiences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These three (highlighted ones) are immensely connected with each other and quite dependent on each other as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you publish your content on blogs or create audios/videos, you need the distribution of the same content through multiple platforms to get deserved recognition. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where social media platforms play its role. Though building an audience online is possible only with a deep understanding of the online communities on each platform separately. As each social media platform as a different role to play in building the audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And, these platforms work as a network as the source of a huge amount of granular audience differentiated on the basis of demographics, gender, interests, or education level, etc. Though this differentiation may sound weird in the beginning they can help to steer your content marketing strategy in the right direction. </span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>How does audience analysis can help you plan a successful content marketing strategy?</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience analysis can play the role of a compass in an ever-changing but challenging content marketing world. As different content and social media trends, such as cinematography or stories, visual content come and go, however, the knowledge of your audience can help you to stay on track and feel connected with your followers. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While studying social media analysis, it allows you to understand which piece of content is well appreciated by them. Also, it helps to experiment which format seem interested to your audience. You can use these insights to plan a long-term content strategy and organize your content-production teams more efficiently. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you are into e-commerce, then your audience would cherish <a href="https://digiperform.com/why-is-visual-content-important-for-your-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual content</a> in the form of pictures and videos rather than simple text blogs. What can you do with this piece of information? Well, you will be able to build an effective <a href="https://digiperform.com/free-courses-chapter-2-how-content-marketing-relates-to-marketing-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing funnel</a>.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-18840 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" alt="" width="375" height="375" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your audience allows you to create any form of content for each stage of your content marketing funnel strategy. We always suggest creating compelling visual content as it helps you to achieve the best results and your business objective which ultimately leads to end goal &#8211; </span><b>Conversion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as the </span><b>Happy Customer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h2><b>How to identify your audience for content marketing strategy?</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Conduct Market Research</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you really want to know your audience, all you need is to conduct a complete market research. Ideally, the market research helps to get as many details as possible about the group you’re targeting. This information you can also use later to build personas.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to do your research. Like you can make your action plan as per the <a href="https://digiperform.com/visual-content-marketing-statistics-marketers-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visual content marketing statistics</a> available on the internet which gives you a binary idea about your market and the way the audience prefer to watch &amp; interact with. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of marketing tools can help you gather an abundance of data about your target audience. These digital marketing tools range in price but can provide assist you in building a foundation of information, ranging from basic demographic data to specific habits and interests.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you can do brainstorming with your teammates, reach out to other departments like a sales team. They have the practical insight that also helps you to understand the buying behavior of your audience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, sit with digital marketing SEO department, they are very keen on marketing insights that will help to make strategies according to audience behavior. (SEO department will help to provide insight into the words customers use and what concerns are commonly brought up.)</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Research Social Networks</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Social networks are the best way to read your customer’s minds and behavior. This action plan is termed as </span><b>Social Listening</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which consists of monitoring the various social networks to discover that is being said about the brand, your competitors stand in the market and comparison along with topics relevant to your business. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can even identify trends in your audience’s interests and problems. With the same study, you can identify their preferable platforms to communicate where you can listen to their social conversations as well as determine what type of content will be the most valuable and relevant to them.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Create Your Own Survey</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys can be very helpful when you want to gather more information about your audience as per the general demographics. Demographics, such as age, gender, income level, education, employment, etc. helps you to understand your audience at the next level and prepare your strategies accordingly.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.22.52-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18937 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.22.52-PM.png" alt="" width="520" height="422" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through surveys, you can survey a large population of interest, such as your existing customer base or potential market. The idea of surveying should process through online only. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience is more active on online platforms. With online surveys, the data is you obtain is quantified and gives you statistical results about your population. It reflects trends and commonalities (instead of individually) among your audience.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Build &amp; Identify Audience Personas You’re Targeting</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you collect various types of data from your audience, the next step for you to start building your audiences’ persona. Marketers, as well as content creators who use the study of these personas, achieve 73 percent higher conversions in their marketing strategy.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A persona is more than a buyer’s profile. A buyer persona is the representation of your prospect (ideal customer) based on market research and actual data about your existing customer base.</span>
<a href="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.24.36-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18938 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-30-at-5.24.36-PM.png" alt="" width="463" height="394" /></span></a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a persona help to differentiate between the real and abstract audience. That will help you create right targeting content for them and engage in genuine conversations with your current and potential customers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, It isn’t enough to just list down the personas and differentiate them into categories. Describe them in detail and describe each one.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can club basic demographic data along to categorize personas, but also other relevant information, such as the person:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interests</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain points</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priorities</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personality traits</span></li>
</ul>
