			<p><strong>1. What is PPC marketing?</strong></p>
<p>PPC (Pay Per Click) is a way to drive and turn traffic to a website through Search engines and partner websites. It is a type of internet marketing which involves advertisers paying a fee each time their ads are clicked, the advertisers only have to pay if a visitor visits or clicks on their ads.</p>
<p><strong>2. Describe AdWords in brief?</strong></p>
<p>Adwords is an online procedure by Google to help businesses promote their products and services through search engines and associated websites. Through certain defined Adwords, you can place a text ad that appears when somebody searches for terms or phrases associated with your services or product.</p>
<p><strong>3. Explain how Adwords work?</strong></p>
<p>The whole Adwords system is based on bids and proposals. If you place a higher bidding price, definitely your ads are going to appear on the top of the search engine result pages. And as stated we all know that Adwords works on clicks which means you only have to pay the bidding or proposed amount if a person clicks on your ad.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which settings you cannot change after an Ad account is created?</strong></p>
<p>The Currency and Time Zone settings cannot be changed or edited after creating an ad account.</p>
<p><strong>5. What is Quality Score?</strong></p>
<p>Quality Score is an algorithm that is calculated for each keyword between 1 to 10. The Quality Score defines the quality of keywords compared with Ads and Landing Page. This algorithm is used to calculate the AdRank, which is used to calculate the position your ads would be placed.</p>
<p><strong>6. What is the impact of the Quality score on CPC and Ad Position?</strong></p>
<p>Quality Score is inversely proportional to CPC and directly proportional to Ad Position. That means higher the QS the benefit would be lower cost and higher ad position.</p>
<p><strong>7. What is Actual CPC?</strong></p>
<p>It is the actual cost of a click for an advertiser in an auction. The actual CPC is calculated in real-time making it nearly impossible to calculate the Actual CPC, but we can calculate the Avg. CPC.</p>
<p>Actual CPC = (AdRank to Beat/QS)+$0.01</p>
<p><strong>8. What Kind of Quality Score can you achieve for keywords?</strong></p>
<p>In my past campaigns, I was able to achieve a QS ranging from 7 – 10, but definitely, I can advance the quality score by using optimization techniques in ad campaigning.</p>
<p><strong>9. What are the Factors which affect Quality Score?</strong></p>
<p>Quality Score depends on the following logarithms</p>
<ul>
<li>CTR of the Keyword</li>
<li>The significance of Keywords and Ads</li>
<li>Landing Page Quality</li>
<li>Historic Account Data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. How can you Improve Conversion Rates?</strong></p>
<p>Conversion rates can be improved by creating ads that match rightly with the keywords and by creating compactly themed ad groups so that we can get targeted users to the best landing page.</p>
<p>By improving the Landing Page quality, also the conversions can be improved.</p>
<p><strong>11. Can PPC Advertising affect the ranking of websites on search engines?</strong></p>
<p>No, not possible as the Search Engines never mix them. Google and other search engines rank both organic and PPC results separately.</p>
<p><strong>12. Can you tell me the limit of the character used for PPC Ads?</strong></p>
<p>Expanded Text Ads limit the uses as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 Characters – Headline 1</li>
<li>30 Characters – Headline 2</li>
<li>80 characters – Descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard Ads has the limitation of a maximum of 25 for headlines 1 and 2 combined. 70 for descriptions</p>
<p><strong>13. What is an Invalid Click and how does Google determines the invalid clicks?</strong></p>
<p>Invalid clicks are fake clicks, termed unintentional and malicious software clicks. Google has a refined mechanism and algorithms to automatically detect and filter invalid clicks from the users&#8217; accounts.</p>
<p><strong>14. What are PLA Ads (Shopping Ads)?</strong></p>
<p>PLA (Product Listing Ads), is an ad strategy used to advertise product ads on Google search and associated partners. This campaign is also called a Shopping campaign mostly since it is mostly used by E-commerce websites.</p>
<p><strong>15. What is meant by Converted Clicks?</strong></p>
<p>Converted click is a metric that tracks the total no of clicks which resulted in conversions. This metric is criticized and not entertained by Google.</p>

			<p><strong>1. What is the Re-marketing Audience and how to generate this list?</strong></p>
<p>The re-marketing audience is the users who visit our websites, by using the Google remarketing tag on our website, we can add the users we wish to our audience list.</p>
<p><strong>2. When can the CPV be charged for an in-stream ad for a video of 60 seconds in length?</strong></p>
<p>A CPV can only be charged If the user watches at least 30 seconds of the published video.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is meant by Search Terms?</strong></p>
<p>Search Terms are the exact keywords for which your ads were triggered or generated.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is meant by Price Extensions?</strong></p>
<p>Price extensions are a new format of extension, intended to display the price of the relevant products.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are Affiliate Locations Extensions (ALEs)?</strong></p>
<p>ALEs are special extensions that link the location. These extensions are useful for brands to display the names of retail stores where the product is available offline.</p>
<p><strong>6. How will you manage the Google Quality Score?</strong></p>
<p>Google’s Quality Score is based on three things:</p>
<p>1- keywords</p>
<p>2-ad text</p>
<p>3- landing page relevance.</p>
<p>To maintain the highest score possible, it’s best to use fewer keywords and targeted ad groups. This way, we can write more targeted copy that will more likely find its position. PPC experts should be well-known with Quality Scores, how they work and how they improve the quality (with all these in mind sometimes, you may not even want to focus on Quality scores.)</p>
<p><strong>7. Can you explain how the Google auction works?</strong></p>
<p>Digiperform &#8211; Google Auction works</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40034" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blog-300x73.png" alt="Digiperform - Google Auction works" width="399" height="97" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blog-300x73.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blog.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>The auction process goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user enters a search, AdWord pulls out all the ads with relevant keywords matching that particular search.</li>
<li>From these ads, those which are not eligible, such as ads that target a different country or specific ads that have been disapproved, will be ignored.</li>
<li>From the ads remaining, only those with a high enough Ad Rank will be shown as results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since It’s a crucial stage of your campaign, make sure anyone who is involved with it knows the process and how to get the most out of it.</p>
<p><strong>8. How does Ad Rank affect the cost per click (CPC)</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to charging the CPC (the actual amount you’re charged per click), at the most you will end up paying the minimum amount required to hold your ad on the position.</p>
<p>In the Search Network, ads that appear above the search results generally have a higher CPC than those that appear below the results.</p>
<p><strong>9. What is click-through rate (CTR), and how is it calculated?</strong></p>
<p>The Click-through rate (CTR) is a ratio that shows how many people are clicking on your ad after seeing it. It is calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions. The total number of clicks is divided by the total number of impressions = click-through rate.</p>

			<p><strong>1. What are some things you can do using the Google AdWords API, and would you recommend using it?</strong></p>
<p>While the AdWords API offers a variety of tools and functions. It&#8217;s highly recommended that it should only be used by those with dedicated business services and needs that can’t be met through other AdWords tools. It should always be ensured and kept in mind to hire an expert who knows when to call in the API — and when not to.</p>
<p><strong>2. What third-party tools do you use for keyword discovery?</strong></p>
<p>Outside of Google’s own search query, there are plenty of tools to help discover new and related keywords. A few of them are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Keyword Planner Tool.</li>
<li>SpyFu.</li>
<li>SEMrush.</li>
<li>Bing Keyword Research Tool.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Why is it recommended to separate Display Network campaigns from Search Network campaigns?</strong></p>
<p>The answer may vary by campaign, as Google explains that different campaign settings can be more effective on different networks.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is the On-Schedule Indicator (OSI)?</strong></p>
<p>The On-schedule indicator takes the traffic-shaped ad server goals into account and will represent a more accurate measure of the delivery status. It is recommended for networks that are enabled to pace based on expected traffic,</p>
<p><strong>5. How long should advertisers wait after creating a new display campaign before analyzing its performance?</strong></p>
<p>As Google recommends it should be for two to three weeks. But it depends from campaign to campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. What do manage placements allow advertisers to do?</strong></p>
<p>The managed placement allows the advertisers to Bid differently for specific placements on the Google Display Network.</p>
<p><strong>7. What are the benefits of remarketing?</strong></p>
<p>A person who is an expert in PPC marketing should be familiar with remarketing and able to outline its many benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Targeting users when they’re most likely to buy.</li>
<li>Lists are created for specific purposes.</li>
<li>Large-scale reach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Is my site well equipped to handle tracking requirements to ensure that remarketing campaign works?</strong></p>
<p>In order to know whether your site is well equipped to handle tracking requirements, you should ensure that the site is able to support the required pixels or codes, even before you begin your remarketing campaign.</p>
<p><strong>9. What are the most important KPIs to measure success?</strong></p>
<p>Remarketing, like any other campaign, comes with a set of metrics to keep track of. These include CTR, cost per click (CPC), effective cost per acquisition (eCPM) and return on investment (ROI). Before you start, make sure you know what your goal is and which key performance indicators (KPIs) best reflects it.</p>
<p><strong>10. What types of remarketing are there, and which is best for my campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Remarketing is not a size that fits all the users, within the ad type itself, there are many options including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site remarketing.</li>
<li>Search remarketing.</li>
<li>Email remarketing.</li>
<li>Social media remarketing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. Which audience segment should I target?</strong></p>
<p>Once you decide on the type of remarketing, the next step is choosing a segment. As an expert, you should be able to tell the difference between general visitors, specific product visitors, previous customers etc. and which one is the most appropriate process applicable for the given campaign.</p>
<p><strong>12. Should I use a list automatically created by AdWords?</strong></p>

			<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some best <a href="https://digiperform.com/annual-digital-marketing-program/">Courses after 12th for Arts</a> &amp; Humanities Students?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which course should I pursue after completing 12th from the Arts stream?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I go for the BA Program or should I pursue English Honors? </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of you will choose BA, as it’s easy and you don’t have to study or prepare throughout the year. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what about career opportunities? Have you ever thought about your future, and what will be your career in the next 3 years?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us show you some stats that indicate the employability among graduates with a Bachelor of Arts degree across India from 2014 to 2022.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39585 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-6-300x196.png" alt="jobs stats " width="621" height="406" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-6-300x196.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-6.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, employability among graduates of Bachelor of Arts was only about 44 percent, marking a small increase from about 43 percent in 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate of unemployment – or misemployment – of graduates in the humanities is a sign of something grievously wrong with modern societies and their university systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year large numbers of students pass out 12th with Arts/Humanities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And one question that keeps running in their minds is &#8211; what are my career options after completing 12th from Arts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanities is a field of study, which is inspired by history, language, cultures, societal norms, philosophy, visual arts, music, and other intellectual aspects of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The field of Arts and Humanities has a lot of career options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But you have to choose the best option that aligns with your interest and also has growth opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Career prospects in Arts or humanities can enclose a few of the most fascinating and alluring jobs in the market. The job list includes a variety of roles such as editor, digital marketing strategist, multimedia specialist, analyst, and much more.</span></p>

<h4>Difference Between Degrees and Courses</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparing the degree and certification courses, we might get confused about choosing the right option for better career growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, we often look over the pros and cons of both sides and after that, we are not completely satisfied with our decision as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we start with the degree, it is a kind of reward given after completion of a longer period of the course. You can obtain a degree from a university or college at different levels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The degree might land you the job you want but can take a longer period of time. After completion of the degree, you need certification courses for boosting your career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that comes again in the picture is the difference in cost between <a href="https://www.lorman.com/blog/post/whats-the-difference-between-a-certificate-and-degree">degree and certification</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The certification cost is much lower than a degree course upon that, and the flexibility and time period are shorter than a degree course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing about the certificate program is that it can be pursued along with the degree course and you may get high-paying jobs after completion of the course. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Wrapping Up!</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are a few great career courses after 12th in Arts. You can proceed with anyone for better career growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope, you can conquer a few clear questions such as; What to do after the 12th? and more similar to the above guide. After that, you can crosscheck parameters like;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price of the course</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficulty level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time period of the course</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through these parameters, you can surely land a perfect course and target a great high pay scale job.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to kick start your <a href="https://freelancewritingjobs.com/">freelance writing</a> career? Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started. </span>
<h2><b>Pick a Niche or Expertise </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the saying goes &#8211; ‘riches are in the niches’. The first step to successful freelance writing is to pick a niche. In order to pick a niche, ask yourself what topics you like talking about. For example, if you have been working in a certain field, you may have specific domain knowledge that you can write with ease. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying a gap can help you enter a market that has less competition. For example, if you are a nurse or physician, you immediately have a leg-up on most other medical writers who do not have your credentials. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also make a list of your hobbies and find out what you love to write about. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so will make you enjoy the process of working as a writer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the niche you identify seems too narrow, it&#8217;s important to open yourself up to expanding your knowledge to widen the net of clients you can pitch to comfortably.</span>
<h2><b>Develop an Online Presence</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you decide to write under your name or a pseudonym, it’s important to build an online persona that reflects the brand that you wish to build. Create profiles on freelance marketing sites where clients come to look for talent.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t limit yourself to one platform, at least not in the beginning. Once you find directories and groups that generate regular income for you, you can stick to those. However, in the beginning, it’s all about casting a wide net and seeing what works. </span>
<h4><b>Build a Portfolio</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have picked your niche, it&#8217;s time to build your portfolio. Initially, it might be difficult to get clients to pay you so you may have to offer to guest post on other blogs for free. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To create published samples, offer to guest post on websites, blogs, and podcasts within your niche. Some organizations pay for guest blogs, but when you first start out, you can think of it as a free promotion of your brand. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest posting online gives you credibility and provides a link you can share with your potential paying customers. However, websites frequently change their content and there&#8217;s no telling how long your article link will remain active. That&#8217;s why many freelancers <a href="https://www.pixpa.com/blog/build-resume-website">create a website with samples and information about themselves</a> that establishes their credibility and expertise. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most writers have a portfolio menu item with their samples and other menu items with information about their interests and experience. Building your website as a business website shows professionalism and an understanding of the digital realm where you hope to make a living. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>How to Select Sites for Guest Posting</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may take time, but once you know the sites your audience finds most useful, search for related sites where you can build a reputation. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for sites that meet the following criteria:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your target audience hangs out there</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience size can help you reach a steady stream of clients</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have high domain authority (rank well in keyword searches)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Start a Blog</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have a niche and a way to put your name in front of potential clients, consider building a blog to establish authority in the market you wish to target. Ideally, people searching the topic will also land on your blog page and reach out to you for writing jobs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can pick any of the top blogging platforms like WordPress or Squarespace. They also let you buy a domain and host your website. Pick a theme that’s simple with less clutter which will help your users navigate and find your work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking some web development courses can help you maintain your website without paying someone else to do it. If you get good enough at it, it may even become a future writing niche for you!</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Level Up Your SEO Skills</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engine Optimization or SEO describes strategies used to improve the ranking of websites on specific search engines. As a freelance writer, you need a deep understanding of how SEO works in order to write content that improves the ranking of your client&#8217;s website on the Search Engine Results Page. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of free resources on the internet that’ll help you level up your SEO copywriting skills. Content Optimization Tools like </span><a href="http://usetopic.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help speed up your content writing process.  </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Look for Writing Jobs</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the top sites for beginners searching for freelance writing jobs. As you become more experienced you will find others more specific to your niche.</span>
<h3><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/affiliates/pompu73"><b>Freelancing.com Job Board</b></a></h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The brain is fresh and ready for action early in the morning. If you work, you may want to get up an hour early to get your writing in for the day. Pick the time that fits your schedule the best.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to that of a social media marketing strategy, you must create a resume building strategy as well. Once you have figured what goes where you are ready to start typing.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s begin with the first and the most important segment of a resume- Name and Contact Information:</span>
<h2><strong>The information included in this particular segment is very precise</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You mention your full Name and not first name or last name or your nickname. Make sure that you do not use any shortcuts or short forms of your name.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your contact details such as phone number and email address. Along with that, it is advised that you mention the link to your LinkedIn profile. Hence, it is important that your LinkedIn profile is updated.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering it is a Social Media Specialist resume if you are someone who has a website, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter handle and you maintain it properly, it is advised that you mention the links to these as well.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Given below is a simple example of how you can set this segment.</strong></h2>

<hr />

<em><strong>ALEXA JONES</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="color: #333399;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact- 666-555-1234, alexjones01@gmail.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location- Ontario, Toronto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website-www.alexajones.com</span></span></em>
<em><strong>LinkedIn.com/in./alexajones  Alexa.jones.1</strong></em>

<hr />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next segment or part of the resume is usually called ‘Profile’ or ‘Career Summary’ or ‘About’ or ‘Professional Career Summary’.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This segment should represent what you have done or learned so far or what skills you possess. It should focus on your skills/core competencies and how much work experience you have. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a short paragraph at the top of a resume describing your level of experience and key skills. It gives an overview of your expertise and encourages the hiring manager/recruiter/employer to read your whole resume.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet again keep in mind the usage of keywords in your resume, pick keywords from the job description provided and utilize them in your career summary as well. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your career summary should tell a story about you and it should entice the recruiter to dig deeper into your resume. </span>
<h2><strong>Given below is a sample Career Summary.</strong></h2>

<hr />

<em><b>Career Summary</b></em>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #333399;">I have a passion for sports, marketing, graphic design, and social media. Bringing creation, imagination, and determination all together on the drawing board in order to produce something great. Experienced in Photoshop, InDesign, AfterEffects Premier Pro, and other Adobe Applications. Demonstrated knowledge of various social media, strong work ethic and a professional attitude.</span></em>

<hr />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Work Experience comes after Career Summary/Professional Summary. Considering the job position is that of a Specialist, he/she should have relevant experience in Social Media handling. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A fresher would rather apply for the positions like Social Media Intern or Social Media Executive. </span>
<h2><strong>The format of writing work experience is as follows:</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">List your most recent jobs in reverse chronological order in this section of your resume.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designation</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name of the company/organization</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work tenure</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsibilities handled</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any specific accomplishment while on job</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that the recruiter wants to know what you achieved or how many goals you reached while you were on your previous job and not how many pages you managed. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is any person can manage accounts; it’s about how you handled it and how far you were able to take its follower number and viewership. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What you achieved while handling those accounts and what strategies you used in order to reach a particular target. Alexa has been passionate about sports and she has worked with sports firms handling their social media presence. </span>
<h2><strong>Given below is her work experience sample.</strong></h2>

<hr />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Including Education Background in a resume is the next step after Work Experience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking into account, there are specific degrees for Social Media, it would not count much. But it is always suggested to mention them anyway. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">List a Master’s Degree, then your Bachelor’s Degree (reverse chronological order).</span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is experienced would be expected to mention references in his/her resume. References are used to cross-check the candidate’s caliber, behavior and work history. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">References can be your ex-colleagues, manager, HR or if you are a fresher then you can mention your mentor/professors’ name and contact information. </span>

<hr />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always keep in mind that your resume has to be relevant to the reader&#8217;s situation: Your possible next boss will be able to see in a second whether your resume has zip-all to do with her situation, or not. </span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you get any </span><a href="https://vijaybhabhor.com/seo-tips-for-students/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO tips for students</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">throughout your college marketing courses? </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like most students, that was not the case. Your professors tackled digital marketing in general, and you learned a lot. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there weren’t any SEO scholars there to prepare you for a <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-career-in-digital-marketing-will-shine-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career in the digital marketing industry</a>. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine optimization is such a complex process that it’s hard to tackle in a college course. There aren’t definite rules, and the practices are ever-changing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why professors don’t like to cover it, and it’s why universities don’t educate SEO scholars.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it’s possible to get into an SEO career right after college. You’ll have to learn a lot and practice different techniques. You’ll experiment with trial and error, too! However, you’ll be entering an interesting field that shapes the digital marketing industry for the most part. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only question is: <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-get-a-job-in-seo-as-a-fresher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how do you get an SEO specialist job right after graduation</a>?</span>
<h1><strong>7 Ways to Get a Job in SEO after College Graduation</strong></h1>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>1# Make Sure This Is What You Want</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many recent graduates aspire to SEO positions because they can easily get into freelancing and there are many open positions on the <a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-jobs-career-opportunities-for-fresher-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital marketing job market</a>. But they don’t love SEO as a profession. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter a while, they realize it’s too “technical” and they don’t find it exciting. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start applying for positions, you’ll need to get deeper into the learning experience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn as much as possible and work on your own projects. These initial steps should be enough for you to figure out: Is this the career part you want to pursue?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Constant challenges are part of SEO. Nothing is final. You’ll always have new things to learn and new techniques to try. For many recent graduates, that sounds like an exciting opportunity. Others find it overwhelming. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great thing about SEO is that ideas matter. If you have amazing ideas and you perform well, the years of experience won’t matter. You’ll make progress! </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest problem with this career is the work-life balance. It’s a hard thing to achieve since SEO is not something you do as a 9-to-5 job. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some hiring managers will consider you because you’re young and they assume you have a lot to give. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They will expect you to be constantly online and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accept extra tasks when necessary. SEO is done on weekends, on holidays, and during summer vacations. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not that great at time management, the job will suck the life out of you. However, having so many opportunities to work is also a good thing. You&#8217;ll just need to set your limits. </span>
<h2><b>2# Learn at Your Own Pace</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After you graduate from college and start thinking about a career in digital marketing, your first thought will be: “I need to get an SEO certification.” Don’t go there! It’s not necessary to hold a certificate. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes; a certificate is good because you get it after a structured program that teaches you something. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll learn from legit experts, who know what they are talking about. It also proves that you mastered SEO skills up to a certain level. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, certification programs have their downsides as well. They don’t emphasize practice; they emphasize education. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already tool marketing courses at university, your degree should be enough to prove your education. Employers are after the experience, so to <a href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-get-a-digital-marketing-job-as-a-fresher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get a job in the digital marketing industry</a> you should focus on that.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you learn? You’ll find amazing online resources that give you the knowledge you need. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try </span><a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Beginner’s Guide to SEO</span></i></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Moz and </span></i><a href="https://seths.blog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seth Godin’s blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From there on, it will be easy to identify the experts in the digital marketing industry and learn from them. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But remember: it’s not just about learning. It’s mostly about the practice, and that brings us to the next point.  </span>
<h2><b>3# Focus on Essential SEO Skills</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginner level, a hiring manager will ask if you can do these things:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage and analyze websites through Search Console</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Google Tag Manager</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Google Analytics</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Google’s search operators</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform on-page and off-page SEO</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write optimized content</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build links that would improve the search engine rankings</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a crawler tool</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find and fix indexed error pages</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor the results of an SEO campaign and adjust the strategy accordingly</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lot. No one said this would be easy. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start learning, focus on these essential skills that you’ll definitely need for employment in the sector. </span>
<h2><b>4# Get Some Experience through Your Own Project</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll need something feature in your resume and LinkedIn profile. You can’t apply to an ad for an SEO job without any previous experience. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to start your own website. It can be about anything you like; just choose a niche you feel passionate about. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, focus on search engine optimization. Your goal is to get your site featured in Google’s first suggestions on a relevant quest. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re already guessing: there’s a lot of learning to cover before you get to that step. It’s not easy to beat your entire competition and end up on the first page of results. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember those services you turned to when you were thinking “I </span><a href="https://edubirdie.com/write-my-essay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need someone to write me an essay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”? You can work with those writers again. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll give them the ideas and keywords, and they will develop good content for you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just about keywords and content, though. It’s about finding the right topics, targeting the right keywords, and maintaining the right balance in your posting schedule. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is a lot of work, so stay committed to it. Once you make your website successful, you’ll have something to show off. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any recruiter will be willing to consider you as part of their marketing team.</span>
<h2><b>5# Choose Your Specialty </b></h2>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SEO specialist</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a broad term. If you learned anything about search engine optimization, you know it’s a complex concept that involves several steps: data analysis, content marketing, blogging, social media marketing, and more. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you skilled at?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are a few of the positions you can aim for:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media specialist</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid search specialist</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO manager</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content strategist</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive director of digital marketing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account manager</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing manager</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing analyst</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developer with a focus on SEO</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO specialist</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing coordinator</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing manager</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since SEO is an aspect of digital marketing, you have a large sector to target. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to focus on a single position and gain the needed skills for it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re a specialist, you’ll easily gain a recruiter’s attention. You’ll stand out between applicants with general experience. </span>
<h2><b>6# Start Applying</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have the needed knowledge and some experience to showcase in your application, you can get on the job market. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most beginners decide to start with freelancing platforms, such as </span><a href="https://www.upwork.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwork</span></a>, <a href="http://airtasker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airtasker</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PeoplePerHour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They are a decent source of opportunities, especially for entry-level positions in marketing teams. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re good enough, you can keep collaborating with returning clients outside the platform, and aim for a higher position in their team.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, LinkedIn should remain your major focus. It’s where recruiters search for candidates. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get noticed in discussion groups, and you can post your own content. Present yourself as an expert in the industry!</span>
<h2><b>7# You’re Just a Beginner, So Don’t Get Greedy</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Search_Engine_Optimization_(SEO)_Analyst/Salary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayScale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the median pay for SEO analysts is $49,263 per year. Senior analysts earn much more (around $70K). </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re just a beginner, you can’t aim for such high amounts. You have college loans to pay off, rent to pay, and a life to live.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> You might think that $37K per year is too low, but keep in mind that it’s just a start. It’s your chance to prove what you know and gain experience through your first job. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you combine an entry-level job with freelancing activities, you’ll earn more money and tons of experience that will get you to a better position. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many recent graduates offer their SEO services for free at the beginning. They find a small startup that hasn’t developed an SEO strategy yet. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They contact the owner, offering a project that’s free for a month. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the owner sees the results, they will want to collaborate. Even if they don’t sign a contract, they will give you a great recommendation for a job well done. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t keep working for free forever, but it’s something to consider if you’re not getting job interviews right from the start.     </span>
<h1><strong>SEO Is a Great Career Choice!</strong></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is nowhere near its end. If you become a specialist, you’ll have a productive career. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t assume that you’ll have it easy. First, you must work on your own online project and prove that you learned from it. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll try different techniques, create case studies, and feature the results on LinkedIn and other platforms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll dig into big data to analyze different SEO techniques. With this approach, you prove that you’re a dedicated SEO specialist who knows how to make a website popular. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It won’t take long before recruiters start noticing you. </span>
