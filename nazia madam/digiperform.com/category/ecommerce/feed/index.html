										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the online apparel industry, the return rate is at least around 30%.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as compared to 8.89% in brick-and-mortar stores. 92% of consumers surveyed said that they will buy again if product return process is easy whereas 79% of consumers want free return shipping. One out of three clothes purchases made online is returned. This rate of return is unacceptable for other industries. Imagine if one out of every three mobiles got return from customers, or one out of three travelers canceled their hotel booking.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Online retailer, you have to understand that customers are unable to try on clothes. They are limited to touch and feel the product. They cannot figure out the right size and they would probably get confused with size variants such as regular US size, UK size, plus size, slim fit, Petite size, etc. That is why fitting is the top reason that customers make returns. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of the online apparel stores use size charts as a tool to help shoppers make fit decisions but those return rates are not decreasing. One of the reasons is because those size charts place a burden on customers who may not even have a measuring tape to size themselves up with or don’t know how to do it correctly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clothing stores need a reliable tool to help improve sales at a lower cost. They would choose to be able to provide more accurate measurements for the customers, lower return and less complaints to handle. Also, less inquiries from customers about the sizes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the solution for apparel ecommerce stores is to move on from using those outdated sizing charts or costly unreliable technologies, and instead just get the size recommender application.</span>

<a href="https://www.sixatomic.com/envision-size-fit-analyser"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envision Size &amp; Fit Analyser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses artificial intelligence-driven (AI) analyzed tens of thousands of bodies and develop predictive models that are over 97%+ accurate for 50 detailed measurements. It’s a smart size analyzer application that guides customers to buy the right size. Customers can get an accurate size analysis in under a minute, wherever they may be in the world. They just need to answer simple questions, like their height, weight, typical sizes, and body shape. No size charts, or tape measures required.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all realize the disappointment of ordering clothes online but when we receive them, they don’t fit. So, this application is designed to help store owners to identify the specification of the product, reduce the return rates, reduce abandoned carts due to sizing issues and guide customers to buy the right size using their height, weight, typical sizes, and body shape.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By integrating this app to help shoppers make better fit decisions, online retailers can reduce return rates and customers have more confidence in making a purchase when they are shown exactly how the product will fit them. Also, they will be more confident to revisit the site and make more purchases in the future. </span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/how-to-reduce-returns-and-increase-conversions-for-shopify-online-clothing-stores/">How to reduce returns and increase conversions for Shopify online clothing stores</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running an eCommerce business is not the easiest thing. It is a dynamic combination of modern technologies that merchants should embrace. A Microsoft eCommerce platform is the epitome of online business solutions because it comes with amazing features to manage operations, provide a marketplace, process payment solutions, and help teams collaborate, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being new to this environment can pose a big challenge. So, newbies should first understand what a <a href="https://digiperform.com/do-you-wish-to-earn-the-microsoft-certified-azure-fundamentals-certification-follow-these-5-steps/">Microsoft</a> eCommerce platform is and how it works, then learn about the important features and benefits before making a decision. For new online business investors, this is the right article to read.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h4>What is a Microsoft Ecommerce Platform?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As hinted, this is a digital solution for online businesses. It uses the architecture developed by Microsoft under the ASP.NET framework. According to professional developers, this is the most affordable, flexible, and secure programming framework to use, which is why it is preferred by most eCommerce solution developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers create a multi-vendor environment that accommodates several merchants who can create and manage product pages while enjoying many other features as well. There is a lot more to learn, so it is advisable that you</span><a href="https://virtocommerce.com/microsoft-ecommerce-platform"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">look at more info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a relevant website.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Features of a Microsoft Ecommerce Platform</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a newbie, it is important that you understand the features to look for in a new Microsoft eCommerce Platform. This way, you will choose the best platform to suit your needs, and help achieve your business goals, especially increasing sales and scaling the business up.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multivendor capability – This is an important capability that allows many vendors to use one marketplace while they can edit their individual pages at the same time. Hence, they can determine the product information the clients will see in the marketplace.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multichannel selling platform – Microsoft eCommerce platform provides many selling platforms and allows vendors to promote their products there. For instance, promoting products on social media platforms.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headless eCommerce approach – With this approach, the Microsoft eCommerce platform provides solutions for most of the operations of a business while the vendor is left with few front-end operations to handle.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure payment solutions – Any online business should have a secure payment system. ASP.NET platforms offer exactly this to all the vendors. Furthermore, the transactions are accurate and instant. They also handle financial disputes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing tools – Isn’t it great to have a platform where one can market products, enhance their website’s SEO, and achieve other marketing goals. With a Microsoft eCommerce platform, this is very possible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrations with other solutions – The last feature to check is the integration with third-party solutions that add value to the platform. You may need to go through all of the integrations to determine one that works for you.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>How to Buy a Microsoft Ecommerce Platform</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, any Microsoft eCommerce Platform is affordable because developers use the open-source architecture given by Microsoft. So, the common platforms should not leave a hole in your pocket, especially if you are a starter in the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good thing is that they have a free version, although the features might be limited. Choose well and pay for what gives you value for your money.</span></p>

			<p>Not every business believes in digital marketing and generating buzz at all costs. Not if it means faking reviews from bots and masquerading followers on platforms so that engagement is automatically high with more likes, shares, and subscriptions. But is that not what every business wants at both local and global levels?</p>
<p>For authentic customer or user engagement, you’ll need an expert behind the scenes. When you’ve established business goals and objectives, you’ll need to find an expert who is aligned with your organization.</p>
<p>Expert network platforms like <a href="https://cleverx.com/">CleverX</a> can help you find world-class talent from across the globe. But you still need to avoid expensive mistakes in <a href="https://cleverx.com/blog/the-basics-of-market-research/">market research</a> before you launch your next project.</p>
<p>Read on for the top five questions to ask yourself before you hire a digital marketing consultant for your e-commerce business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hiring a Digital Marketing Consultant for your Ecommerce Business</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Are they qualified?</h4>
<p>Here’s where you gauge how competent and knowledgeable the consultant is. You may want to look into projects that are along the lines of the work you need. Vetting out consultants would need you to look beyond the educational merits.</p>
<h4>2. How would to track and measure goals?</h4>
<p>Another crucial question to ask before you hire a consultant is how to track your progress to. Communicate with them and see how they prefer to work, document reports, and confirm the frequency at which they would offer advice.</p>
<p>If you are looking for non-strategic, performance-based work, you’ll need to set clear expectations there as well.</p>
<h4>3. What are their commercials?</h4>
<p>Gig-workers may charge by the hour, by the ROI, or by the project. Many <a href="https://web.ahttps://digiperform.com/top-15-digital-marketing-institute-in-noida/">digital marketing</a> experts charge a percentage of your marketing spends. You should know their payment preferences and see if that works for you before you decide to hire them.</p>
<h4>4. Are you aligned?</h4>
<p>While you are <a href="https://cleverx.com/blog/23-best-practices-to-negotiate-technology-contracts-in-2020/">negotiating terms</a>, it is important to find out which topics, decisions, or areas of advice they do not hold fiscal standards to. You can ask the consultant to disclose any potential conflicts of interest. It may also help if you ask your advisor for a reference if you have not already approached them through one. You can talk to the references yourself for a better understanding.</p>
<h4>5. Do they have the secret ingredient?</h4>
<p>Transparency is the secret ingredient. It is important to be able to express things that matter to you and receive simple advice without jargon. You will need to have these negotiated terms signed in black and white and easily verifiable.</p>
<p>Transparency breeds social trust, two foundational experiences for a healthy working relationship with your consultant.</p>
<p>Before you sign up, remember to knock these things off your checklist.</p>
<p>Ask yourself if the consultant is making you feel like your problem is too complex to be managed by yourself.</p>
<p>The ideal expert would give you the flexibility and <a href="https://digiperform.com/9-agile-practices-every-digital-marketing-team-should-adopt/">agility</a> to take back your business challenges into your own hands. Even though, that external point of view will bring immense value to whatever you’re working on.</p>

			<p>An effective marketing strategy is a crucial requirement for all businesses, especially when your business is in its early stages.</p>
<p>Your marketing strategy can make all the difference in how fast your business grows. So, it’s one of the key points that you must focus on.</p>
<p>Now, running and planning to expand your eCommerce business is often quite tricky. That’s where search engine optimization (SEO) can make things simpler for you.</p>
<p>It plays a crucial role in your online marketing strategy. So, you must utilize it to its fullest to benefit your eCommerce business.</p>
<p>Don’t know where to start? No worries, we have some useful SEO tips to help you out with that. But, before that, you might want to know how this concept works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does SEO work?</h2>
<p>As you know, there is a wide range of eCommerce businesses out there. Moreover, customers have many options to choose from across all sectors.</p>
<p>Now, to look for a certain product online, needless to say, they have to search for it. The results they get are always in a particular order. You’ll find a certain website always at the top for a certain search word.</p>
<p>Now, customers usually open the top search results that they get. So, every eCommerce business would always want to rank high among search results.</p>
<p>Now, how does a website get to that position? As you might have guessed, that’s where <a href="https://uaewebsitedevelopment.com/seo-services-for-ecommerce-websites/">eCommerce SEO</a> comes into the picture.</p>
<p>Optimizing your content according to customer trends will help your eCommerce site rank high among search results. And, that in turn would bring in more visitors to your website. And, for that, you simply need to apply the right SEO practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6 Best SEO Tips for your eCommerce website</h2>
<p>There are many ways to utilize SEO to benefit your online business website. But, there are some essential steps that you must take for that. So, here are some SEO tips that would help you increase your website’s ranking:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Maintain SSL Certification For Your Website</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The content surely plays an important role in a website’s ranking in search results. But, whether the search engine trusts the site is yet another crucial factor. Now, what makes a browser trust your web page? In case you’re wondering, it’s an SSL certificate. So, you must make sure that your website always has one. After all, SSL certificates come with a certain validity period.</p>
<p>Also, you must get the certification from a provider whom the search engine trusts. What happens if you don’t have an SSL certificate? In such cases, your site data won’t have any protection.</p>
<p>Thus, people who try to visit it will face a privacy error. As a result, they might not want to visit it, which will affect the site ranking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Make Your Content Unique</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your eCommerce website would have a wide range of products. Also, each of them would have a certain description. Now, as it happens, you’re not the only one offering those products to your customers.</p>
<p>Instead, there are many other businesses out there that are competing with you. And, they use a specific description for their products as well.</p>
<p>Thus, you must make sure that you uniquely describe your products. In other words, it must not match with that of another site. For that, you should avoid using the description that the manufacturer uses for the product. Instead, simply write all the descriptions for your products in your own words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Place Enough Keywords In Your Text</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your customers will search for products using a particular keyword. Then, the search engine will show results that contain that word. Keywords play an important role in your site’s ranking.</p>
<p>After all, they indicate the contents of your website to the search engine. Now, your content must have a minimum number of keywords. Otherwise, it won’t make much difference to your website’s ranking.</p>
<p>There might be multiple keywords that you need to use in your content. In that case, place each of them naturally throughout the text. Make sure not to force them into any part of your content. After all, that will only deteriorate its quality, which can bring down your ranking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Use More Specific Keywords</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some general keywords that pretty much all of your competitors would use. That indicates you would face a considerable amount of competition when you use them.</p>
<p>So, it gets a little more challenging for you to rank high in search results. Therefore, you’d want to reduce the competition to make that easier for you.</p>
<p>And, for that, you must avoid using general terms and use more specific ones instead. For example, suppose you’re offering sports shoes to your customers on your website.</p>
<p>Now, using the keyword “sports shoes” is going to get you into competition with hundreds of competitors. To avoid that, you must add a location or other specific details. That brings down the number of competitor websites that you have to compete with for ranking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Use The Appropriate Heading Tags</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The tags you use in your headings are more important than you might think. The search engine uses them to understand the hierarchy of your content. So, you must make sure that the search bots can read them properly.</p>
<p>And, for that, you have to use the correct tags. Always use H1 for your titles and H2 for subtitles. If there’s a title within an H2, you must use the H3 tag for it.</p>
<p>What happens when you use incorrect tags? In such cases, the search engine can’t read it properly. As a result, it won’t be able to rightly determine the hierarchy of the content.</p>
<p>Apart from that, visitors would find it harder to browse through the pages of your website. Now, that would surely affect your site’s ranking in the search results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Include Customer Reviews On Your Website</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you offer a service or product to your customers, you’d want their feedback. After all, it’ll help you satisfy them, and hence you can witness growth in your eCommerce business.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it’ll also let you create better strategies and make better decisions. If there are any issues with your service, you can know that easily from customer reviews. That will help you make the necessary changes to remove any shortcomings on your part.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it’ll allow customers to interact with your business. Now, that’s one of the key requirements for any business to grow. That’s why all prominent eCommerce websites allow customers to share their feedback through ratings and comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finally……</h2>
<p>So, it is clear that you need more visitors to your website to grow your eCommerce business. And, for that, you must increase the number of visitors that your website gets.</p>
<p>You need a well-planned SEO strategy for that. Also, you must make sure to include the above-mentioned essential practices in it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, they’d help you gain a significant number of organic traffic on your website. Apart from that, you can apply many other effective practices as well.</p>

			<h3></h3>
<h3>1) Brand Awareness</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any online business, brand awareness is a must to make a dent in the e-commerce universe. Thanks to disruptive platforms such as Shopify and Etsy, the e-commerce space is packed with countless players more than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make people recognize your brand and products, you need to tell them your brand story. Digital marketing is an excellent way to forge a connection between your brand and customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It uses various channels to reach the right audience through compelling storytelling with visual and audio elements. Social media promotion, PR, Pay-per-Click (PPC) campaigns, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) are important channels to market your brand and products digitally. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2) Credibility</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People may not trust your online business at first glance. You need to convince the audience that you are a trustable business. Content pieces, reviews, accessibility, and excellent customer service are some of the ways to build trust with your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketers will leverage social media and marketing trends to instill trust in your audience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They gather customer reviews and testimonials through digital marketing and display them at the right spots to get more eyeballs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to build trust is through cleverly written articles, product descriptions, videos, etc. Whatever the content may be, you need a suitable medium to communicate it to your audience. Digital marketing can be that medium since 59.5% of the world&#8217;s population use the internet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3) More Traffic</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of ways to bring traffic to your e-commerce website in digital marketing. To name a few, social media, email marketing, content optimization, link building, and influencers are some of the best bets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s see the value and potential of each. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An effective social media marketing can harvest the power of social media to its full extent. Witty-yet-sensible responses to customers&#8217; queries on social media, hashtag campaigns, and contests are a few ways to bring in more traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing is an effective tool to make people not only visit your site but make them subscribe to your email list. Features like personalization abandoned cart alerts, and shoppable emails are great in making people land on your online store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content optimization techniques involve improving your existing content and drafting new content to make them easily discoverable by search engines. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4) High Conversion</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons for eCommerce stores&#8217; low conversion rate is marketing to the wrong people. The likelihood of a site visitor becoming a buyer highly depends on the purchasing intent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot drive 1,000 random people to your website and expect a quarter of them to buy your products. Ecommerce does not work that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Digital Marketing, you can target the right people at the right time so that the chances of them becoming your customer is high. The first strategy is through keyword research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is searching for something online is far likely to make a purchase sooner than one who may or may not be interested in the product. But to reach the former, you need to have the right digital marketing strategy in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urgency and scarcity meters, PPC ads, heat maps, call-to-action (CTA) buttons, and native advertising are a few Digital Marketing techniques to boost the conversion for your e-commerce store. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5) High ROI</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the traditional forms of advertising, PPC, SEO, email marketing, and social media advertising give you a better ROI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s begin with the power of SEO. According to a </span><a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-roi-of-seo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Moz, for every $1 spent on e-commerce SEO, advertisers get $2.75 in return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to Google Ads, the results become even juicier. According to Google, for every $1 spent on Google Ads, advertisers, on average, earn $8 in return. Read this Google </span><a href="https://economicimpact.google.com/methodology/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more insights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by </span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/ecommerce/ecommerce-seo-roi.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searchenginejournal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has even more exciting results. Nearly 49% of the respondents say that Organic Search, aka SEO, has the highest ROI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 18% consider that social media gives the best ROI, 14% believe email marketing is the real ROI king. Only 19% responded that Paid Search gives the highest ROI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that social media marketing, email marketing, and SEO are part and parcel of Digital Marketing. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6) For High Perceived Value</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your product may be an out-of-the-world one. But there is no need for your audience to think the same way. To make them understand the true value of your product or service, you need to tell your customers that you, too, go through blood, sweat, and tears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. They need to know the amount of effort you put in to bring a product to life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital advertising is the most effective method to increase the perceived value of your product and e-commerce store. It allows you to tell impactful stories using which you can position your brand in the desired way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next comes </span><a href="blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">user-generated content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reviews, and testimonials. These things will create a positive image among the fence-sitters and even the tire-kickers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7) Recurring Benefits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frustrating thing about all forms of advertising is the recurring expenditure involved in it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shell out a certain amount and enjoy a steady stream of traffic for a while. The moment you stop spending on ads, the traffic to your e-commerce site dries up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if you need not invest every single time to get traffic. SEO is the way to go. Now, that does not mean that you invest once and forget it. SEO is an ongoing process, and you still have to spend money on it. But compared to advertising, it&#8217;s way more cost-effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the benefits, aka traffic, you get out of SEO can last for years, if not decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, advertising is buying traffic. In contrast, SEO is earning traffic. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8) Boost in Social Following</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because social proof is a prerequisite for the masses to follow you without being told, social media marketing is vital to get a headstart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social following greatly influences your audience. Effective social media marketing will shape customers&#8217; perceptions and make them follow you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once things are on a roll and you gain a sizeable following, the campaign will snowball. Upon witnessing that many are following your account, more and more will join the bandwagon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketers employ specific strategies to make your ecommerce brand follow-worthy. They will make the audience invested in your brand by running contests and giving shoutouts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers will ensure your brand&#8217;s relevancy by using the correct visual elements and hashtags and sticking to a posting schedule. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9) To Build an Authentic Customer Base</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A carefully executed digital marketing strategy is a must to earn a loyal following. Fans are extremely important to make your e-commerce business sustainable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because loyal customers tend to indulge in word-of-mouth publicity, you need them to build a positive image for your business among the masses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing can get you customer insights such as their likes and dislikes. Digital marketers, using the buyer persona, then develop a personality for your ecommerce business that appeals to the target audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, they set the tone and voice for your brand. Apart from defining a personality for your brand, they run polls and contests to make the audience feel connected to you. Giveaways, shoutouts, quick responses to comments are the ways digital marketers use to create brand loyalty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>10) Ability to Track Performance</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing can help you know how your campaigns fare among the target audience. Using the right digital marketing tools, you can get access to valuable customer data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the data, you can personalize and optimize your marketing campaigns. Analytics also tells you which campaigns performed well and which ones have tanked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data can help you channel your time and resources towards the campaigns that are likely to strike a chord with your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great benefit of analytics is that it can help you segment your customers. Segmentation is essential to personalize your marketing campaigns. Personalization, in turn, will result in more conversion and brand affinity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11) Know Your Competitors</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing what your competitors are doing is essential to devise your strategies. Maybe you want to dominate the domain where your competitor is shining or fill a void that your competitor has not captured yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, you need raw and undiluted data to create an action plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say that you optimize your online store for a set of important keywords. You wait, wait and wait. But traffic seems to be a thing that can give an elusive thief a run for her money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You scratch your head, analyze data and find that your competitor is killing it on the exact keywords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You realize that it is not worth optimizing your site for the same keywords and start concentrating on low-competition keywords that your competitor ignores. As a result, your rankings go up, and so is the revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you had not analyzed the data, you would still be trying to rank high for the keywords your competitor is dominating. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>12) Dictate Prices</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a new entrant to the e-commerce space, you don&#8217;t have enough say in pricing. Because you have not gained a spot in the market, you need to price your products competitively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you price your products competitively, there is no guarantee for traffic unless you vehemently advertise them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&#8217;t have a deep pocket, you will be left with slim profits or perhaps even losses. The way to overcome this situation is to position yourself in the market and make your presence felt across your target audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing can help you achieve this by promoting your e-commerce business across multiple channels. By bringing in a steady inflow of right traffic, you can now dictate the prices. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>13) Break Boundaries</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going global is an exciting dream for any business. If you are an e-commerce business, expanding your business to new regions is no more a dream but a naturally occurring phenomenon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But going global or national is easier said than done. You need to know the ins and outs of the region and the people you intend to target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing will help you understand people&#8217;s preferences, views and wows, income level, educational qualification, purchasing power, and whatnots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a successful expansion plan, mere observations won&#8217;t help you, but hard-hitting data do. Take the case of Starbucks&#8217; failure in the Australian market. The coffee giant miserably failed in understanding the local coffee culture and adapting to them. </span></p>
<p><b>This is what happened:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Australians love coffee but not as Americans do. They are known for their love for latte, cappuccino, and flat white coffee. They also prefer to have a snack with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">coffee. Starbucks failed to understand this and priced the items as they did in other markets. The result was a </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/20/starbucks-australia-coffee-failure.html#:~:text=There%20are%20basically%20no%20Starbucks%20on%20this%20continent.&amp;text=Despite%20Australia's%20deep%20love%20for,nearly%2090%20locations%20by%202008."><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Australians felt that Starbucks&#8217; coffee was overpriced. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coffee company ended up closing 61 stores and sold 24 others to Withers Group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they had done a comprehensive market study, they could have avoided the failure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3>14) Better Customer Relationships</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is very little room for hiccups in customer relationships when it comes to digital marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the rise of social media, today, a good volume of interaction between brands and customers occurs on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that makes brand-customer communication a breeze in social media is the quick turnaround time. Because a negative comment can trigger a public backlash, brands never hit the sack when it comes to social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multinational brands such as Nike, Walmart, and Starbucks have separate handles to address customer queries. The comments section is also a nice little place where brands can sway public opinion with quirky responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your response may be a funny reply or an acknowledgment of a mistake. Irrespective of its nature, your brand visibility and customer relationships become better and better with social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3>15) To Make Your Customers Feel Special</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is crucial for every business for long-term success. To harvest loyal customers, you need to cultivate a habit of personalizing messages and offers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization goes beyond sending birthday cards and saying &#8216;Happy New Year, John!&#8217; As an e-commerce brand, knowing a customer&#8217;s preferences, previously viewed products, purchase history, and browsing behavior will allow you to personalize the marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s say a visitor has searched for inflatable pools on your e-commerce site a couple of times but never made a purchase</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a robust product recommendation plugin installed on your site, you can display a list of inflatable pools when the user visits your site next time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or you can curate a list of best-selling inflatable pools and send them to the user in a shoppable email. This will make the communication genuinely personalized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2) Is Digital Marketing a Costly Affair?</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of these, only PPC is Paid Advertising. Though you need to invest money for all other digital marketing strategies, PPC, as the name suggests, is a &#8220;Pay As You Go&#8221; type. In layman&#8217;s terms, you only need to pay when someone clicks on your ads. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also one of the best strategies that give you an impressive ROI. According to this </span><a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/email-marketing-roi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for every $1 you spend on email marketing, you get a return of $40. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5) Which Digital Marketing Strategies Suit eCommerce the Best?</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s say you run Google Shopping ads for your men&#8217;s fashion brand, and a customer searches for &#8220;Black Tuxedo.&#8221; </span><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/2660968?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google shopping ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will display your &#8216;Black Tuxedos&#8221; at the top of search results. As a result, you will get high-quality leads. </span></p>
