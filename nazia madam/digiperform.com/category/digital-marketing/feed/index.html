Begin With What You Already Know</h2></div></div></div><div class="pix-el-text w-100  " ><p class="  text-body-default  " >Your target audience is comparable to individuals you know. Take a look at your existing connections to see if any new ones could be interested in what you do. Is there a commonality in their ages?

Put a Priority on Online Content Marketing</h2></div></div></div><div class="pix-el-text w-100  " ><p class="  text-body-default  " >Content marketing&#8217;s breadth and importance are growing.

Increased organic traffic and a better search engine ranking may be achieved </span><a href="https://direction.com/local/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<ul>
<li>On-page SEO includes keywords, long-tail keywords, metatags, and SEO-friendly URLs.</li>
<li>Off-page SEO focuses on website backlinks. Guest blogging boosts SEO and gets backlinks for your site.</li>
<li>To increase your website&#8217;s SEO, concentrate on its technical aspects.</li>
</ul>

Influencer Marketing</h2></div></div></div><div class="pix-el-text w-100  " ><p class="  text-body-default  " ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencers are someone with a significant following or high authority in a sector.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencers who love diamond jewelry and share the company&#8217;s values are essential. So, a new diamond business owner shouldn&#8217;t be nervous about starting out small.</span></p>

You or a business rep may broadcast a podcast to describe your services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing an effective marketing proposal can be challenging. As marketing results are rather difficult to track, it can be complicated to determine the true return on investment of </span><a href="https://digiperform.com/5-most-effective-digital-marketing-channels-for-your-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any marketing approach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketing proposal (digital and traditional) allows you to demonstrate to a prospect precisely how you intend to implement a strategy while taking into account all of these aspects.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to know what you have to come up with a great proposal, follow the steps listed below.</span>
<h2><strong>Do your homework and learn more about your client</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your ideal customers need to be positioned front and center in a marketing proposal. This entails conducting research on the company or organization that the client owns or operates, determining the client&#8217;s issues and marketing requirements, and gaining an awareness of the client&#8217;s rivals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The time spent researching will be worth it in the end because it will result in a more thorough proposal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye out for what is known as </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/uncover-business-pain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pain points</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the marketing industry. A pain point is a problem with the client&#8217;s marketing plan that needs to be corrected. However, the client is either unaware that there is a problem or doesn’t know how to fix it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A poorly targeted advertising campaign or an inadequately monitored </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7761-facebook-business-guide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are two examples of potential pain points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Early research should be conducted to locate these issues and then surprise the customer by describing the problem as well as the solution before the client even asks for it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional information can be obtained by having a conversation with the customer about the project and trying to get a sense of where they are experiencing difficulty. During your conversations with the client, topics such as the amount of money they are willing to spend and the time period should be discussed.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Write an outline</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After you&#8217;ve done your research and made a plan of action, do a basic sketch or framework that you can use to present all of your information in the best way possible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why templates are so important for making quick and clear proposals. As with many business documents, marketing proposals will have a standard set of information about your business as well as the goods and services you offer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For each business type, you can write a good proposal. If you’re struggling with this step, it would make sense to take a look at various </span><a href="https://www.proposify.com/proposal-templates/digital-marketing-proposal-template"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital marketing proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> templates and make the process even smoother.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Templates make it easy and quick to speed up this task, which can turn something that used to take days into something that can be done in minutes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After you&#8217;ve done your research, you&#8217;ll need to tailor your service offering to meet the business needs of your customer.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Craft an action strategy</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After putting together everything you&#8217;ve learned, you&#8217;ll make a plan for the client. This plan will be the basis of your proposal and it will help you figure out how to make your outline.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use action plans to figure out how to talk to project stakeholders, what tools you can use to deal with their unresolved issues, and how you can help them solve their pain points while helping them reach their goals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the &#8220;sales plan&#8221; part of the proposal. Each problem on this list should have a problem statement and a possible solution based on customer conversations. For example, if the client&#8217;s social media advertising doesn&#8217;t use targeted keywords, this is the problem.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out how much time each suggested solution will take. The timetable for the proposal will be based on this and this is where you will figure out how long it will take your team to finish their part of the job.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Sit down and write</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You now have all the important elements that you need to craft a great marketing proposal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start writing your proposal, keep in mind that you need these essential parts included in the proposal:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive summary;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cover page;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timeline;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action plan.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Bonus tip: Make a memorable cover page</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your proposal&#8217;s cover page should serve as an aesthetically pleasing introduction to the rest of the document. If you’re putting together a proposal for a client, the cover should prominently include the client&#8217;s company name and logo.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal should immediately make clear that the focus is on the organization and vision for the project. As you will be handing this over to stakeholders and decision-makers, you should make sure that the cover page is both aesthetically pleasing and eye-catching.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Final words</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal is your entry into the client&#8217;s business. As a result, it should look as professional as the rest of your customer-facing materials. So, make it count!</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/writing-a-marketing-proposal-follow-these-5-steps/">Writing a Marketing Proposal?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">A customer’s experience with your company and brand never stops because your business consistently delivers experiences with each interaction and touchpoint. However, the question is whether it is an experience that moves prospects and customers closer to purchase or away from the purchase. </span>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this sense, </span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/customer-experience-marketing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer experience marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plays a crucial role in exceeding customer expectations throughout the entire customer journey. And to achieve that, you need to understand customer behavior and expectations and deliver on these expectations.</span>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, let’s see the best practices you can deploy to give customers more than expected.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>#1 Use a customer experience management platform</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An effective </span><a href="https://www.alida.com/actions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CXM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform is essential for businesses to succeed in today’s digital world. It helps organizations use technology with a human touch to proactively take action on customer feedback by listening and responding to requests appropriately and on time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it allows management to get better insights into customers’ behavior, optimize communication and decision-making, and secure exceptional ROI. Ultimately, good CXM software assists in creating a customer’s journey that enhances brand image. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>#2 Continuously invest in your customer support team</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your customer service is not superb, customers quickly lose trust in your company. Assume, on the other hand, that your team is aware of how much you value and invest in customer experience. In that instance, it may provide the motivation they require to go the extra mile. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That means creating a culture that values customer service is a top-down process. How to start? Identify the training and development needs of every customer support team member. Think of everybody, but start with managers. In addition, schedule and track your team’s development through coaching, group training, and even self-paced eLearning. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>#3 Create a self-help knowledge center for your customers</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To elevate your customer experience, create a self-help learning center where prospects or existing customers will visit to solve a problem independently. You can store different content materials, FAQs, answers, or tutorials about your product. The available documentation will not only help customers to resolve their problem unassisted but also gives them a realistic peek at your support offerings.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How to start? Focus on the following aspects:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your customer service team about the most pressing problems your customers are facing.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess the number of inquiries and the level of impact on the customer experience for each relevant topic.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule monthly meetings with your team to select new topics to add to the knowledge base.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the exact terminology customers use as it helps your content creators develop content that resonates with your audience. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to always publish content with an educational angle, as a good customer experience is built around high confidence in using your product. Moreover, go beyond the basics and share goal-driven tutorials and exciting case studies. </span>
<h2><strong>#4 Work on your content marketing </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing is one of the most influential aspects of your customer experience, as many questions along the customer journey circle around your product capabilities. That means you need to design your marketing campaigns to deliver precise and consistent messages. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you need to clarify how the sale works if you are running a promotion. Furthermore, use a consistent multi-channel approach to sales</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">so that customers get a consistent brand experience regardless of whether they are shopping from a desktop or mobile device.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>#5 Give your customers enough choices</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a more significant number of choices makes customers feel that they can exercise </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/328552"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more control over their purchases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One way to do it is by offering flexible pricing plans to suit different needs and budgets. Additionally, customers appreciate brand accessibility through a variety of channels and devices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this direction, make sure that your website is mobile-responsive and develop an app to make interactions easier. Giving your customers choices regarding payment methods is another strategy worth looking at. Credit or debit cards payment, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal are obvious choices.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>#6 Build a relatable brand personality</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To help your company stand out from the competition, you need to create a unique brand personality with human characteristics. Making it easier for your target audience to relate to your company and brand will help your prospects and customers feel like part of a family, helping you build a loyal customer base.  </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong business will already have great customer relationships. However, an innovative company that strives to always do better will consistently be wondering how to improve customer service and provide an extraordinary experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding customer service is built by carefully and continuously listening and attending to your customers’ needs and desires. So, if you are not constantly looking for opportunities to improve your customer service, your relationships will stagnate. As a result, your customers will simply quit purchasing from your company.</span><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com/customer-experience-marketing-6-best-practices/">Customer Experience Marketing: 6 Best Practices</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digiperform.com">Digiperform</a>.</p>

			<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some best <a href="https://digiperform.com/annual-digital-marketing-program/">Courses after 12th for Arts</a> &amp; Humanities Students?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which course should I pursue after completing 12th from the Arts stream?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I go for the BA Program or should I pursue English Honors? </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of you will choose BA, as it’s easy and you don’t have to study or prepare throughout the year. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what about career opportunities? Have you ever thought about your future, and what will be your career in the next 3 years?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us show you some stats that indicate the employability among graduates with a Bachelor of Arts degree across India from 2014 to 2022.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-39585 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-6-300x196.png" alt="jobs stats " width="621" height="406" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-6-300x196.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-6.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, employability among graduates of Bachelor of Arts was only about 44 percent, marking a small increase from about 43 percent in 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate of unemployment – or misemployment – of graduates in the humanities is a sign of something grievously wrong with modern societies and their university systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year large numbers of students pass out 12th with Arts/Humanities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And one question that keeps running in their minds is &#8211; what are my career options after completing 12th from Arts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanities is a field of study, which is inspired by history, language, cultures, societal norms, philosophy, visual arts, music, and other intellectual aspects of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The field of Arts and Humanities has a lot of career options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But you have to choose the best option that aligns with your interest and also has growth opportunities.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a career that aligns with your interest ensures that you are on a valid career path. It offers various benefits such as job satisfaction, motivation, career success, and much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you actually want to build your career in the right direction, use the following steps to determine your career interests:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Identify your general interests </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying your general interests will give you a great foundation to begin when looking for your ideal career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out your career interests, start by analyzing your usual interests or hobbies. Consider your hobbies and activities that you love doing in your free time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you might enjoy reading novels or writing short stories. These interests might lead you to a career as a writer or author.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. Make a List of Various Career Options </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After identifying your general interests and hobbies, make a list of potential careers that matches your interests and overlap. For example, if you are interested in aquatic life and you are good at science, you can add marine biologists to your list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing a list of various career options matching your hobbies and interests will help you narrow down your options when it’s time to finalize. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note down as many options as possible so that you have numerous options to choose from. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. Research careers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have prepared a list of career options that match your interests, narrow down your options and research every job role. Analyze job requirements and responsibilities. Understand the job roles and nature of the job to help you decide your career path. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. Utilize your network</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After gathering information regarding the jobs you are interested in, get in touch with the people connected to these professions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask them about the job roles. The pros and cons of choosing this job. Knowing about the positive and negative sides of a job will help you narrow down your career options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Importance of Certification</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/digital-marketing-certification-important-freshers/">Earning a new certification</a> in a particular area of expertise can help you to grow or boost your career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certification Course helps an individual showcase his competency, and commitment to the profession, build expertise in his professional subject area, and helps with job advancement. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_39587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39587" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39587" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/importance_of_certifications-300x158.png" alt="Importance Of Certification" width="580" height="305" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/importance_of_certifications-300x158.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/importance_of_certifications.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39587" class="wp-caption-text">~ Whizlabs</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a designation earned by a person giving a kind of assurance to the company of his potential in performing a job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a certificate, you can show that you possess specific knowledge, skills, and experience, and prove that you meet a specific set of standards or requirements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certificate or certification is always awarded by an independent third party, such as an institute of learning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some of the key benefits of certification include</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validation of knowledge</span></li>

<h3>Top Certification Courses After 12th For Arts Students</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year a lot of students prefer the Art stream to pursue their careers. Although there are several myths that the art stream is for academically weak students, this is completely wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to this, there are loads of opportunities for the Arts students after 12th. There are plenty of short-term courses, diploma courses as well as degree programs for students who chose the Art stream.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Certification in Digital Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing is a trending industry with loads of career opportunities for newcomers. The industry is predicted to generate 6 crore jobs by the year 2025. Currently, the industry is experiencing a huge skill shortage. The job portals are loaded with various digital vacancies but not enough skilled professionals to fill these vacancies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, obviously, it’s good to have a career in a trending industry!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What is the Future Scope of Digital Marketing?</h4>

<h4>Difference Between Degrees and Courses</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparing the degree and certification courses, we might get confused about choosing the right option for better career growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, we often look over the pros and cons of both sides and after that, we are not completely satisfied with our decision as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we start with the degree, it is a kind of reward given after completion of a longer period of the course. You can obtain a degree from a university or college at different levels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The degree might land you the job you want but can take a longer period of time. After completion of the degree, you need certification courses for boosting your career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that comes again in the picture is the difference in cost between <a href="https://www.lorman.com/blog/post/whats-the-difference-between-a-certificate-and-degree">degree and certification</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The certification cost is much lower than a degree course upon that, and the flexibility and time period are shorter than a degree course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing about the certificate program is that it can be pursued along with the degree course and you may get high-paying jobs after completion of the course. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Wrapping Up!</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are a few great career courses after 12th in Arts. You can proceed with anyone for better career growth.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time period of the course</span></li>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience of your product is essential, and not focusing on it enough will cause the product to fail. This is an issue that has affected many businesses, and it has caused them to shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will tell you about the five biggest UX mistakes that turn your users off. Knowing what these are will help you avoid making these mistakes and learn what you should not do when designing the UX of your product.</span></p>

<h3>5 Biggest UX Mistakes Turning Your Users Off</h3>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Using Responsive Design</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsive design is necessary, and you cannot avoid it. If your website doesn’t have a responsive design, then it will not be successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without responsive design, users will be irritated when using your product, and you need to make sure this doesn’t happen. People use various devices every day, and if your websites cannot be displayed on different devices and screen sizes, they will fail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a UX mistake that new <a href="https://www.tvisha.com/blog/difference-between-ui-and-uxwhich-comes-first">UX designers</a> can make, setting them up for failure. You need to know that responsive design is not a trend, and it needs to be a part of all of your designs. UX design consultant firms like </span><a href="https://clay.global/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will tell you how important this is and ask you to make it a fundamental part of UX design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already started designing your website and haven’t added responsive design, then you need to start again and add it in. If you don’t have experience doing this, hire UX design consultant firms and use their UX services to help you create the best designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never design your websites without making them responsive. You need to remember this and use it in all of your designs.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Using Carousels In Your Design</h4>
<p><a href="https://webflow.com/blog/carousel-slider-design-best-practices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have become a popular design trend, and designers are adding them to their website design without a good reason. This design trend doesn’t add value to the website that the user can benefit from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t need to be a carousel; you need to consider why you are adding something to the design and if it’s giving the user any value. Let’s focus on carousels in this article and use them as an example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the disadvantages of carousels in your website’s design.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They distract the user from the other content that is on the screen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user will need to navigate the carousel to find the information they want.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousels aren’t giving the user any value. The information can be presented in a different way that is less distracting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website’s design can look cluttered if the carousel isn’t in the right place.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would help if you looked at these issues when adding anything new to your website’s design. Don’t just add something because it might look good. Think about how it helps the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to use a carousel in the <a href="https://digiperform.com/importance-of-web-design-development-in-digital-marketing-strategy/">design</a>, you need to make it essential. Give users control, don’t make it automatic. Present information that users will want to know more about. This will cause them to click on the carousel and visit other pages of your website.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Thinking About The Mobile User Experience</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people use their mobiles to visit websites. This is why it’s essential to ensure your website’s <a href="https://digiperform.com/the-importance-of-user-experience-for-digital-marketing/">mobile user experience</a> is excellent. New designers can make this mistake, and it causes users to be frustrated and leave the website. When this happens, they will not return and instead use a different website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about what you should do when designing your website for mobile.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rearrange the content and elements on your website to make them easier to see on smaller screen sizes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make buttons larger, so users don’t have a hard time clicking them to navigate your website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove content that isn’t important. You have less space; you need to keep what the user is looking for and remove everything else.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify the navigation. Make it easier for people to navigate the website.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test your website on different screen sizes and improve to give users the best experience. If you need help designing for mobile, use the UX services that UX design agencies offer.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Discounting Usability</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design needs to be usable. You need to ensure that your design puts </span><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">usability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the visuals. If it doesn’t, this can cause people to have a bad experience when using your website and cause them to leave after a negative first impression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many products fail because they have poor usability. You need to make sure your website isn’t one of them. Understand who your users are and what they want from your product. This is what you should be focusing on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at similar products and identify how usable they are. Do they make it easier for users to achieve their goals? If they don’t, then why would people want to use them? Learn from this mistake and avoid it in your designs.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Not Simplifying</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://digiperform.com/6-steps-to-write-a-perfect-website-design-brief-2/">Designers</a> need to simplify their designs. You need to keep what’s essential to the user and remove everything else. A cluttered design will cause users to leave the website, and you don’t want this happening to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out what users want and give them that. Everything else doesn’t need to be there. If it’s just taking up space and not giving users any value, why is it in your design?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing this requires understanding your users and what they want from your product. Research thoroughly before you start designing the UX of your website. This is how you can create great designs that people want to interact with.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running an eCommerce business is not the easiest thing. It is a dynamic combination of modern technologies that merchants should embrace. A Microsoft eCommerce platform is the epitome of online business solutions because it comes with amazing features to manage operations, provide a marketplace, process payment solutions, and help teams collaborate, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being new to this environment can pose a big challenge. So, newbies should first understand what a <a href="https://digiperform.com/do-you-wish-to-earn-the-microsoft-certified-azure-fundamentals-certification-follow-these-5-steps/">Microsoft</a> eCommerce platform is and how it works, then learn about the important features and benefits before making a decision. For new online business investors, this is the right article to read.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h4>What is a Microsoft Ecommerce Platform?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As hinted, this is a digital solution for online businesses. It uses the architecture developed by Microsoft under the ASP.NET framework. According to professional developers, this is the most affordable, flexible, and secure programming framework to use, which is why it is preferred by most eCommerce solution developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers create a multi-vendor environment that accommodates several merchants who can create and manage product pages while enjoying many other features as well. There is a lot more to learn, so it is advisable that you</span><a href="https://virtocommerce.com/microsoft-ecommerce-platform"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">look at more info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a relevant website.</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Features of a Microsoft Ecommerce Platform</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a newbie, it is important that you understand the features to look for in a new Microsoft eCommerce Platform. This way, you will choose the best platform to suit your needs, and help achieve your business goals, especially increasing sales and scaling the business up.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multivendor capability – This is an important capability that allows many vendors to use one marketplace while they can edit their individual pages at the same time. Hence, they can determine the product information the clients will see in the marketplace.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multichannel selling platform – Microsoft eCommerce platform provides many selling platforms and allows vendors to promote their products there. For instance, promoting products on social media platforms.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headless eCommerce approach – With this approach, the Microsoft eCommerce platform provides solutions for most of the operations of a business while the vendor is left with few front-end operations to handle.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure payment solutions – Any online business should have a secure payment system. ASP.NET platforms offer exactly this to all the vendors. Furthermore, the transactions are accurate and instant. They also handle financial disputes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing tools – Isn’t it great to have a platform where one can market products, enhance their website’s SEO, and achieve other marketing goals. With a Microsoft eCommerce platform, this is very possible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrations with other solutions – The last feature to check is the integration with third-party solutions that add value to the platform. You may need to go through all of the integrations to determine one that works for you.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>How to Buy a Microsoft Ecommerce Platform</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, any Microsoft eCommerce Platform is affordable because developers use the open-source architecture given by Microsoft. So, the common platforms should not leave a hole in your pocket, especially if you are a starter in the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good thing is that they have a free version, although the features might be limited. Choose well and pay for what gives you value for your money.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone once likened </span><a href="https://worldfinancialreview.com/5-digital-marketing-strategies-for-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generating B2B leads </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in today&#8217;s market to swimming without hands or feet. You battle hordes of competitors to get your voice heard only to encounter buyers who are shrewder than you thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet B2B leads are necessary if you want to increase sales. How you go about it is what we are going to tackle here.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>1. Account-Based Marketing (ABM)</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B buyers are increasingly demanding exceptional buying experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes beyond providing products/services and into personalizing their entire experiences—which is where ABM gets exciting. Through ABM, you identify your ideal customers, hone into those accounts, and engage with them on a personal level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39554 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-1-300x228.png" alt="Account based marketing " width="530" height="403" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-1-300x228.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-1.png 447w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase effectiveness, companies employ an account-based salesforce strategy where specific accounts are entrusted to individual sales reps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales reps practically own the accounts assigned to them and handle their progression. They curate the most appropriate content to boost engagement, offer timely solutions, and carry the customer through the journey to conversion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top benefits of using ABM include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved optimization. Being a data-driven strategy, ABM allows you to comprehend needs and preferences. You personalize content based on your target account&#8217;s industry and stage in the purchase journey, then send it through their preferred communication channel.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better reporting. If your marketers stammer whenever you ask for a progress report, then ABM is for you. Since this is a focused strategy where detailed plans are drawn at the beginning, your team has fewer KPIs and metrics that can be tracked easily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitates higher engagement and retention. It&#8217;s easier and cheaper to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one. Through personalized content, you boost engagement and trust and forge stronger relationships with customers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offers higher ROI. Research shows that ABM yields higher ROI compared with other strategies. And thanks to the data and metrics in place, you can measure the revenue generated through this strategy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Cold Calling</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key question from buyers nowadays is, &#8220;Does this product/service make sense to my business?&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how frugal consumers have become, you&#8217;ll need to give them a reason to buy and </span><a href="https://saleshive.com/cold-calling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cold calling is the perfect strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39553 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-300x300.png" alt="what is cold calling?" width="519" height="519" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-300x300.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-150x150.png 150w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2-75x75.png 75w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-2.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It affords you direct access to prospects, allowing you to sell the key benefits that will help reach their goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practices include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research your leads. Accessing information about challenges, needs, and preferences in just about every industry is easier now. Most companies also have digital footprints or publicly available information that you can factor into your pitch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalize your script. People will tell you &#8220;use a script,&#8221; we say, &#8220;no one wants to feel sold to, so use the information you researched to personalize the script.&#8221; Set aside high-value customers and personalize the conversation you would like to have with them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep small talk on the low. Greet your prospect, then quickly move on to introduce yourself and state the reason for the call. Asking the prospect if they can spare a couple of minutes to talk sounds polite, but you’re simply giving them the ticket to get out of the call. They can say no and hang up.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measure ROI. It&#8217;s easy to make 50 to 100 calls every day, but how many of those are converting into tangible results? Consider the monthly call-to-conversion rate, how many calls translate to meetings, and the number of deals closed from your cold calling efforts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Use Case Studies</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solid case study embodies businesses, problems, solutions as well as experiences that your target audiences find relatable. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It introduces the problem a consumer faced, their objectives for a solution, the processes they used to find the solution, and the results of implementing those solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39552 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-3-300x175.png" alt="how to use case studies?" width="585" height="341" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-3-300x175.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-3.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case studies validate the value behind your solutions in addressing consumer needs building credibility, generating interest among audiences, and encouraging engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how exactly can they help you?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are proof of success. A case study shows you know precisely what you&#8217;re talking about. It showcases successful solution implementation and the buyer&#8217;s satisfaction level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They outline your processes. Case studies go into detail about the specific processes you used to identify, suggest and implement solutions. They reveal your commitment to resolving your buyer’s problems from start to finish and the positive experiences you offer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They appeal to emotions. Effective case studies go beyond information sheets, ROI, and solutions. They weave a compelling story that appeals to potential buyers&#8217; emotions and influences them to engage you. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Email Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permission-based </span><a href="https://daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay?newsID=947006"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an excellent way of connecting with audiences, boosting awareness, and raising a tribe of loyal customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We say &#8220;permission-based&#8221; because buying email lists gives you access to people who haven&#8217;t voluntarily shared their personal information with you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your emails will probably be labeled spam which is no way of generating leads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39551 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-4-300x193.png" alt="what is Email marketing " width="600" height="385" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-4-300x193.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-4.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, it may take time to build a permission-based list, but it will be worth it since you&#8217;ll be speaking to willing and welcoming audiences. You can consider can outsourcing the process to professionals if your team is stretched or you don&#8217;t have the time to build the list yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how you can secure leads correctly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by identifying your ideal audience. A detailed buyer persona will help you understand the motivations, pain points, and buying preferences of the customers you&#8217;re targeting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create irresistible offers. Use what you’ve learned about your ideal customers to create resources that solve the problems they face. As they download these resources, they will exchange their info with you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work with social media. Run ads on social platforms, promote your offers, and create interesting posts around your offerings. With billions of active social media users browsing these platforms, you will gain followers and generate email leads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share valuable content. Signing up an email lead is just the beginning. You&#8217;ll need to create valuable content that piques their curiosity, engages, and nurtures them so they convert to customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. Leverage Landing Pages</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt-in pages provide a wealth of lead conversion opportunities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are dedicated distraction-free pages for capturing prospective customers&#8217; information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39550 aligncenter" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-5-300x231.png" alt="What landing page?" width="545" height="420" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-5-300x231.png 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-5.png 442w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practices include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversion starts with the design. Go for an easy-to-follow layout with theme-specific colors, well-spaced texts, and visible CTAs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write for conversion purposes, not SEO. With good reason, too. The person is already on your website and your present goal is to move them to action. Use compelling CTAs to trigger action, add testimonials for credibility, and highlight key benefits for the consumer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor performance. Metrics like the number of landing page views, average time on page, visitors-to-contact ratio, and bounce rate reveal the value of your landing page. You can then determine if you need to make adjustments to drive more conversions.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row_visible"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 text-left"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business world has changed drastically in the last few years, with the pandemic sending those in many different business sectors like marketing and advertising home to work. For many of them, it’s now hard to think of going back to how it was before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While remote working was </span><a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2021/11/remote-work-statistics.html#:~:text=32%25%20of%20All%20Employees%20Worldwide,by%20the%20end%20of%202021."><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before 2020, the pandemic has certainly sped this up, as a high percentage of office workers now work either fully remotely or in some hybrid form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though this has many benefits, such as creating a <a href="https://www.shinesty.com/blogs/news/work-from-home-survey">work/life balance</a> and cutting the cost of commuting, it’s natural that there are still some work expectations that haven’t changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially the case for those working in collaborative roles with a wide range of colleagues and teams on a regular basis. This definitely isn’t impossible to do remotely but it does need support from the right places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, having a team that understands the limits of remote working and this new flexible way of doing the job is key. However, team members aside, there are products that can support you when working from home too. Take a look at some of the best that we’ve gathered below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. A Good laptop</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laptops are so versatile now, with whole businesses being run from just a handful of powerful devices. When working from home was made the norm for many workers, laptops were the natural go-to device, as they could be taken home easily and packed up in seconds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have just your laptop, you can go from working in your home office to the kitchen to the sofa in minutes. Have to go into the office one day a week? All you need to do is pack your laptop and head out the door. It made perfect sense that these were the devices of choice for remote workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laptops can do so much more for those who work from home, though, than just provide flexibility. Many laptops are just as powerful as desktop computers, if not more so in many cases, and a good one can be all you need when working away from the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you work on a marketing team and are constantly passing designs back and forth? A laptop that doubles as a tablet may be perfect for this. Maybe you hold meetings with a high number of attendants? Devices with good cameras and crystal-clear screens like </span><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/d/14-inch-laptops"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenovo 14 inch laptops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be all you need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Somewhere you can share documents</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of collaborating with a team is sharing documents and working on them together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be part of the marketing department putting together a presentation for a new client or a member of a group of writers all contributing to a big piece. No matter what you need to share documents for, having a good platform to do so is very important, especially if you are working remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are </span><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3632983/top-file-sharing-services-dropbox-box-google-drive-onedrive-more.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">so many platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do this, some being free and others come at a cost. While there are certainly more well-known ones, it can be a good idea to shop around and see what is out there. You may find that, though one platform has a broad range of everything, another is better suited to your team’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sorts of platforms that allow you to share documents with each other and edit things or work together live were handy when everyone was in the office. They are even more crucial now, though, with team members rarely being in the same room all at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may even find that having this resource available to you allows you to work more smoothly together and get work done much more efficiently than ever before. Being able to collaborate in real-time is very valuable. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. A shared calendar</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote working went global as lockdowns meant no more meet-ups for a while. After this happened, there were many anecdotes of people moving all over now that they weren’t having to go into the office on a regular basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who lived in expensive cities bought houses in more rural areas to save money. Some working in other countries even moved back home, as they could stay at their current job without having to keep going into the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this was clearly the right decision for some, it meant that many of your colleagues were on different schedules and, in some cases, even different time zones. You can no longer look across the office to see if someone is working today or stop by their desk to see if they can make it to a meeting later on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where a good calendar app can really come in handy. Many of them allow you to share your schedule with colleagues and even have different calendars for various groups, teams, and departments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing when each team member has to time off, will be working on something else, or will be in another meeting is crucial for collaboration and can really aid with the shortfalls of remote working. With big projects due and deadlines looming, few things are worse than never having everyone in the meetings when you schedule them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to see when everyone is available, set a meeting for that time, and know that everyone will be there is such a great asset to have. You may also find that there is less back and forth between team members, as everyone is on the same page after one or two meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change to remote working for many office workers has been a blessing. It has allowed them to live elsewhere, balance their work better, and, in many cases, get more done. It cannot run smoothly, though, without the proper resources to help you out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many of these products, you can really bridge the gap between office work and working from home to the point where there is really no difference. With remote working here to stay, it’s time that workers adapted to it, with some help, of course.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing channels help you reach your target audience and establish a relationship with your customers while positioning your brand well to achieve your business goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determining which digital marketing channels to use should come from your unique objectives and target audience. However, it’s essential to understand which ones are most effective for businesses. </span></p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Social Media</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 4.6 billion people globally using social media, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are crucial for growing your business. You can promote services and products organically and create popular content that is likely to be shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, sponsoring paid ads and content can help you complement your message and provide additional touchpoints for potential customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is an informal space which means you can use it to establish more authentic and personal connections with customers. It allows you to build rapport with your brand followers, giving a human touch to your company image and making it more relatable to the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to succeeding on social media is to create relevant content. To inform your decisions better, you should use social media analytics. In addition to the native tools, there are plenty of reliable third-party tools, such as the </span><a href="https://www.pathsocial.com/free-instagram-tools/instagram-profile-analyzer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram profile analyzer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which deliver accurate and reliable metrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging this data, you can curate successful SMM campaigns that resonate with your audience. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Email Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing is still a very effective digital channel for businesses. For every $1 spent, it generates $42. That’s an astonishing </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats?__hstc=76194634.41f2bed6730227cdc0f87e9dd4bfbe4c.1651044027325.1651044027325.1651044027325.1&amp;__hssc=76194634.1.1651044027326&amp;__hsfp=2060133651"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,200% ROI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which makes it one of the most effective options available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email is an excellent channel for promoting products and services, inspiring customer loyalty, and building relationships. It’s also a must for following up with customers, delivering targeted messages, and maintaining relationships to drive continued sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maximize your email marketing efforts, you should build an email list, create engaging content, target your audience, craft enticing subject lines, and strategize the best time to send an email blast. In addition, you can use the latest trends in digital marketing, such as automation and personalization, without breaking the bank. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>PPC</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay-per-click advertising is a specific advertising model where you pay only for the number of clicks your ad gets. This makes PPC attractive to small businesses with a limited marketing budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average cost per click is $1-2. However, it depends on the industry and your target keywords. For example, in competitive industries such as insurance, some keywords can cost up to $50 per click. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main benefit of paid search is that ads are shown above the organic search results, allowing you to capture an engaged searcher before they go to a competitor. PPC results gain </span><a href="https://www.highervisibility.com/blog/organic-vs-paid-search-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more conversions than organic results. It’s also one of the digital channels with great ROI — for every $1 invested, you get $2 in return.  </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>Video Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 70% of consumers prefer to learn about a brand’s offers through video. This format is informative and entertaining, which is one of the main reasons why it has overtaken other content forms when it comes to user consumption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video can increase conversions, enhance ROI, and help you establish relationships with your audience. Moreover, you can promote your products and services through video, educate shoppers, encourage engagement, and even go viral. Well-placed video content combined with a robust video marketing strategy can boost the conversion rate by </span><a href="https://digitalagencynetwork.com/how-videos-can-increase-your-conversion-rate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From demo videos and educational videos to interview formats and testimonial videos, there are plenty of formats you can use to target audiences at any stage of the funnel. And, with the advances in technology, crafting high-quality videos is easier than ever.  </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h4>SEO</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every second, more than 63,000 searches are carried out on Google. And, the first-ranked Google results get an average click-through rate of </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-first-page-clicks/374516/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">28.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, standing in front of the competition means you’ll capture new opportunities organically, driving a consistent flow of leads. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_39444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39444" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-39444" src="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-8-300x200.jpg" alt="Digital marketing channels" width="631" height="420" srcset="https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://digiperform.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unnamed-8.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39444" class="wp-caption-text">Pexels</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a website is likely your first thought when thinking about SEO, this strategy should also apply to all your business channels, including videos, Google My Business profile, social media posts, and your blog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adopting the best SEO practices such as keyword research, keyword optimization, and the creation of linkable content, you can ensure the website comes out on top of the search engine rankings. In addition, SEO is free, so it won’t hurt your marketing budget.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing channels have different outcomes, but the most successful businesses find a way to use different platforms in their marketing strategy to meet business goals. After all, your audience is likely diverse, so using a variety of channels can help you create multiple touchpoints, allowing you to nurture leads and boost conversions. </span></p>
