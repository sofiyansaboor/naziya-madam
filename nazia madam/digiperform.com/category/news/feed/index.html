			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to digital marketing, the trends are constantly changing. One particular trend can go out of fashion and be replaced by another successful marketing tactic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would help if you kept up with the current trends in digital marketing so that your business does not fall behind, and you can get more support when you </span><a href="https://www.edutized.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click for a tutor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most popular digital marketing tactics, techniques, and strategies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Video Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video marketing is gaining popularity with every year that passes by, and it shows no signs of slowing down. One reason for this is that videos are more engaging than other types of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a video on Facebook will have 60% more organic reach than the same post being shared as a picture. It does not mean that you should stop sharing photographs altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means that you should start adding more videos to your strategy, especially if you are trying to market a product or service online today.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Gaming Engagement Ads</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a lot of talk about gaming engagement ads ever since Facebook introduced them in early 2014. These ads have similar advertisements that you see on some of your favorite websites, but they are customized for gamers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The significant part about these ads is that you will find them on video game-related pages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Social Proofing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to increase your engagement rate is by using </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social proof</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It works for both B2B and B2C companies. You can do this by working with influencers, getting reviews from past customers, or publishing testimony-based articles online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Social Media Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media marketing has become a commonplace part of digital marketing. More and more people use social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter to find interesting online content daily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. Live Streaming</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using live streaming is a great way to increase your business&#8217;s outreach on social media, YouTube, and websites. The whole idea behind this technique is that you offer your users a live view of an event, which can be anything from training to an interview.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>6. Native Ads</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A native ad is an online advertisement that fits in with the content on the website it appears on. It means that you can create ads for particular niches without having them look out of place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. Influencer Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing is similar to native ads because you utilize influencers and their following on social media, blogs, and other online platforms to get your brand out there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>8. Paid Search (PPC)</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid search includes any ad that appears when people search for a particular keyword on a search engine. Many people don&#8217;t think this is a viable marketing strategy. However, it is still one that millions of businesses use to increase their online presence and generate more leads for their business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>9. Email Marketing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email marketing will always be relevant in digital marketing because most people check their email account daily. This method is so popular because you can get in touch with your audience directly, build trust through your email messages, and find out more about what they are interested in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>10. Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media optimization involves increasing the number of followers on your account, improving your profile ranking, stimulating conversation, and maximizing your brand&#8217;s online presence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>11. Infographics</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the best methods for creating engaging content for your website or blog. They also rank well in search engine results pages (SERP), which means you will get more traffic to your website if you use infographics regularly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people use the internet to learn about new things, solve problems, and even buy products. If you want your business to succeed online, you have to use modern digital marketing techniques. There is always a need to understand current digital marketing trends.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways of achieving excellent customer retention rates and boosting your sales performance is to be able to offer </span><a href="https://razorpay.com/subscriptions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subscriptions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers like the option to be able to subscribe to the services and products that they want on a regular basis and that is why you need to know which payment platform to use if you want to offer subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a look at the top-rated payment platforms that offer a recurring billing facility and some of the main features that help them to stand out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>1. Razorpay</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility is one of the primary benefits associated with using Razorpay as they allow you the ability to easily instigate recurring payments using the UPI AutoPay feature. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another good reason why Razorpay compares well against many of its rivals is that it offers widespread compatibility with the majority of leading </span><a href="https://razorpay.com/upi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UPI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transaction fees for processing these recurring payments are mainly 2% for Indian debit cards and credit cards. The same rate applies to bank payments or if the customer wants to use a UPI of digital wallet option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>2. LotusPay</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A feature of the LotusPay dashboard is how easy it is to use. This means that you should be able to manage your subscriptions and plans without needing to get too technical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of features are fully automated and you have the ability to create generic plans that vary in amounts and frequency, giving you a good degree of flexibility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>3. PayTM</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you will discover with the PayTM payment gateway is that you can generate subscription payment flows without the need to go through the repurchasing process again each time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a feature that is particularly relevant if you are offering products that are being consumed on a daily basis and you want the ability to collect payments as quickly and easily as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>4. PayPal</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t ignore PayPal when talking about subscription payment platforms as it is such a dominant force in the global marketplace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is tried and tested when it comes to allowing you the ability to collect payments for memberships and other subscription options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal makes it easy to manage your recurring payments and you can use the options available to adjust billing frequency and intervals to your own requirements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fees charged by this global giant reflect their dominance and it is unlikely to be the cheapest provider you can find in the market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>5. CCAvenues</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This provider promises to deliver an automated subscription service that aligns with your specific business needs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can craft your subscription plan around your own unique business requirements and the charges you incur for this service will be based on the number of users you bill in each cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A useful option available with this provider is the chance to offer customers a trial period with the ability to automatically opt-in once the trial period comes to an end. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to compare these sites should allow you to pick the options that are most important to your business and start collecting regular payments as seamlessly and easily as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is well worth getting right, as offering the right subscription options should help you close the sale.</span></p>
