					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiperform.com/key-reasons-why-digital-marketing-is-a-godsend-for-freshers/#comment-68&quot;&gt;Mallikarjuna&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi,
I understand, confusion always comes whenever we need to make a decision related to our career. I would recommend you to go for the quality of training provided by institutes rather asking for job assurance and money. If you will get trained better, you will get the job placement by your own too. You may not need further assistance. Digital Marketing is a skill to be added which will give you the confidence to act and work on your own too.
You can check out our Hyderabad branch to for the same.
Mail me at aditi@digiperform.in if you need more assistance.]]></description>
