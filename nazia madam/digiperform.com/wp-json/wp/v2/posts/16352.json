It\u2019s actually boon for those who are seeking for an additional means to pay the bills, in search of more professional development opportunities or love the freedom that freelancing offers.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, one of the challenges of being a freelancer is continuously finding new clients. It\u2019s now becoming a hurdle for freelancers, particularly ones who are just starting out.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at this barrier, a 28-year-old Nathan Hirsch curates a common platform \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/freeeup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FreeeUp.com<\/a>\u2019 for freelancers and business owners to get connect &amp; explore globally.<\/span>\r\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"text-align: center;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fs4XQGB0Ads\" width=\"750\" height=\"505\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>How did the Journey begin?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a broke college student, Nathan explores numerous ways just to earn side money. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about the beginning, Co-founder and CEO of FreeeUp says,\u00a0<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #993300;\">\u201cI started out just looking for side money and I want to do anything I could do just to make money on the side and what I started doing is buy and sell the textbooks. \u201d<\/span><\/em>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This high impact entrepreneur founded his first e-commerce company out of his college dorm room in 2009 and started selling textbooks on Amazon.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, he started experimenting with sporting equipment, computers, DVDs, toys and baby products.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business was escalated so quickly that at the age of 20, this young man, managed to sell over $25 million worth of product over 5 years. And consequently, he wanted to expand his business dedicatedly to make big. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as a 20-year-old lad, not many people would take him seriously and his hiring zone was limited to just college students. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence he got introduced to the remote-hiring world. But again the journey was not so easy. The freelancing platforms were so complex, exhausting and time taking.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that was a game changer time for him. He discovered the power of outsourcing and ended up building a remote army of freelancers.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>How FreeeUp Works?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreeeUp acted as an online hiring marketplace that allows business owners fast access to a hand-picked network of top talent freelancers.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform interviews hundreds of freelancers each week and only allow the top 1% of applicants into the network. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company has been growing at rapid paces (500%+ YoY) and has quickly become a top destination to hire online for over 3,000 businesses around the world. <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>How to get started as a Business owner:<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> \u00a0Create an account and request the specific worker you need.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Get introduced to the pre-vetted reliable worker.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Start your work &amp; track hours<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>How to get started as a Freelancer:<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Click apply to become a freelancer<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Fill out the application and provide as much information as possible and they&#8217;ll get back to you.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Building yourself as a business and showcasing your skillets? What are the two or three things that you can offer?<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step4:<\/strong> And give the clients experience at a high level<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Facing the competition: <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the conversation, when Nathan asked about the competition, then Young man replied politely,\u00a0<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #993300;\"> \u201cAwesome man that battle was pretty exciting especially like when there are already people out there in the market\u201d<\/span><\/em>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of FreeeUp is far different from others.

It&#8217;s the only thing which you should be focusing more upon when you are running a business or any kind of work because if you take care of your people you don&#8217;t need to take care of your business.&#8221;<\/span><\/em><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People say that the first impression is the last impression, but what I personally think is the first impression is not the last impression, but it may be a lasting impression. \u00a0<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Freelancing platforms are changing the way we work.
