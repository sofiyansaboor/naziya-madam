You can post about your product or brand to audiences from around the world. Here\u2019s how to do just that to grow your car\u2019s Instagram account.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. Build the Right Audience<\/h3>\r\nIt all starts with building the right audience. You want to follow people who are already in your niche and are likely to be\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/best-digital-marketing-strategies-that-will-catch-audience-attraction\/\">attracted to your product<\/a>. They\u2019ll be much more likely to follow you back too, and you\u2019ll start increasing your audience rapidly.\r\n\r\nWhen most social media platforms only let you target by country, Instagram lets you target users by their interests and even location down to a very specific place, so you can share your car business content with users that are more likely to be interested in it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a car shop in San Francisco, you might set up your targeting to target users that like car shops or mechanics that are within a certain distance from your location. Then when they view your profile and like it, they\u2019ll start seeing your posts in their feed as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>2. Share a Variety of Posts<\/h3>\r\nMake sure to post a variety of content to be able to reach all types of users. The more you post, the more likely it is that you\u2019ll be able to get your content seen by users that like your car content.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can post pictures of various cars you\u2019re working on, photos of the different brands that come into your shop, or photos of the mechanics that work there. You can post videos as well. This sounds like a lot of content to make, but it\u2019s actually not bad if you plan it out ahead of time and create standard templates for your posts so that they don\u2019t take too long to create.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>3. Focus on Sharing Quality Content<\/h3>\r\nIt\u2019s important to focus on the quality of your content if you want to lure in users that like your kind of business or brand. You want to show people that you\u2019re a quality business, and you don\u2019t want people to be unsatisfied with your products or services.\r\n\r\nBefore you focus on sharing the content related to cars, make sure to get a driving license. You need to attend a written and practical test that will assess your knowledge of road rules and the ability to drive safely. For the written test, you can\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.driverknowledgetest.com.au\/\">practice DKT test<\/a>\u00a0or be familiar with the questions according to your state, eg. the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.drivingtestcanada.ca\/practice\/g1-ontario\">Ontario g1 practice test<\/a>.\r\n\r\nYou can share helpful posts like tutorials on how to clean your exhaust system, or something about how certain parts in other vehicles work. You can give useful advice for when someone is shopping for their next vehicle as well. You can also post about special events that you\u2019re having or recent installations that you\u2019ve done.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>4. Share Stories With Your Followers<\/h3>\r\nFollowers are the people that have liked your account, so it\u2019s important to interact with them.\r\n\r\nYou can give your followers a chance to be in the spotlight by sharing a story. When you do this, you\u2019ll most likely reach out to people from around the world that are also part of your customer base.\r\n\r\nSome followers will comment on the story and become more interested in following your profile. This can lead to more likes and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/easy-ways-to-gain-followers-for-your-social-media-pages\/\">gain in followers<\/a>, and more money for your business.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>5. Posting photos using hashtags<\/h3>\r\nOne of the best ways to grow your Instagram account is by posting photos that add meaning to these images without being too promotional. Your photo should become a part of the narrative that\u2019s being told by IG\u2019s community. This can be done by describing the photo using one or more hashtags. For example, #bmw can give you additional exposure by linking your post to a large community of BMW owners.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>6. Host a giveaway<\/h3>\r\nBy hosting a giveaway, you can increase your number of followers and likes from people that want to win whatever item you\u2019re giving away. You can create a contest on Instagram, and then make the instructions for how to enter very clear.\r\n\r\nYou should make sure to post about your contest several times to ensure that it gets seen by all of your followers. You can host giveaways by collaborating with car companies as well. For example, you can create a promotion with a local car dealer where they\u2019ll give away car products to your fans.\r\n\r\nYou just need to do a bit of work on your end and put in some effort to gain traction with your audience.
