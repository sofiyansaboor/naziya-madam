Let\u2019s examine why UX and UI matter in this context, and what this means for organic optimization going forward.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">Testing has been taken up a notch<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One catalyst behind the uptick in importance of UI and UX for SEO is that the solutions and techniques used for testing the effectiveness of these facets have improved dramatically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rainforestqa.com\/blog\/user-interface-testing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this testing guide from Rainforest QA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> explains, building an effective strategy for putting UI design through its paces is being enhanced through the use of AI-enhanced automated testing, alongside manual methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, it\u2019s easier to look for and fix usability issues in websites, and the positive impact on search rank that this brings with it makes it doubly recommendable.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">Performance is of paramount importance<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might think that with connection speeds getting quicker all the time, and the 5G era being upon us, there was a bit more leeway when it comes to site design from a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/ranking-factors\/page-speed\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page load speed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality is that having a fast, efficient website which takes an imperceptible amount of time to load, especially on mobile devices, has never been more vital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If pages don\u2019t get delivered swiftly, it doesn\u2019t matter how the rest of the UX shapes up, because you\u2019ve stumbled at the first usability hurdle.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">Accessibility is in the spotlight<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course there are different levels of usability depending on the visitor in question, and the modern web is being geared more towards catering to every conceivable audience member, rather than only to those who are entirely able-bodied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/why-website-accessibility-is-important\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">better accessibility practices<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as including descriptive alt-text for images so that partially sighted people can still consume every piece of content you publish will also result in SEO benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same goes for the way you format content. Implementing specifically-tagged subsections of articles augments readability for all, but also helps those with additional needs harness your site.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">Content is in the UX category<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might assume by this point that this move to UX and UI being under increased scrutiny is a behind-the-scenes SEO issue. However, the quality of the content on your site is just as important as it was in the past, if not more so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone lands on your site and is disappointed in the content they encounter, that\u2019s a UX concern. So don\u2019t just get things like the formatting right, but also invest in well written, relevant copy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise you can still leverage keywords, but stuffing content with high traffic terms is no longer a quick ticket to clicks. Instead, making sparing use of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/back-to-basics-what-does-long-tail-keyword-really-mean-311910\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-tail keywords<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and thinking about satisfying users rather than search algorithms pays dividends in 2022.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">The future is user-focused<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this feeds into the revelation that SEO has reached the point where businesses no longer have to play games to appease the fickle gods of Google. Instead, we\u2019ve reached a stage where it genuinely makes more sense to focus on what\u2019s right for the user, and trust that this will be reflected in a rising search rank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are still challenges involved, of course, but it\u2019s freeing to realize that UX and UI taking center stage is good for site owners and visitors alike.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]There isn\u2019t just one \u2018right\u2019 way to handle search engine optimization, nor a single tool or tactic that will make or break a website.
