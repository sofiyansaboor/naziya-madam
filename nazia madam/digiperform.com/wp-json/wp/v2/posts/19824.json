Here is a step by step guide to writing a perfect internship letter for your digital marketing Internship.<\/b>\r\n<h2><b>Step 1: Addressing a Cover Letter:<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want to miss a golden opportunity to land the interview just because you don\u2019t know how to address a cover letter?<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely not.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorrect addressing of a letter sets the wrong tone. And create a bad impact on the hiring manager.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts to keep in mind while addressing a cover letter<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Do\u2019s<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s always safe to start your salutation with the word \u201c<\/span><b>Dear<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d in a business letter. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know 40% of managers prefer &#8220;<\/span><b>Dear<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d over any other form of salutations.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a proper salutation sets the tone for your letter and proves the receiver that you know basic rules of business etiquette.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just simply use: <\/span><b><i>Dear Anita<\/i><\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your hiring manager has a title such as Professor, Dr., or Captain, then use that title in place of their first name. It gives them a positive feeling.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example: <\/span><b><i>Dear Dr. Batra,<\/i><\/b>\r\n<b><i>Dear Professor Malhotra<\/i><\/b>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Don\u2019ts<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never address a cover letter with salutations like &#8220;<\/span><b>Hello<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; or &#8220;<\/span><b>Hi<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;. It seems too informal. It shows the recruiter that you don\u2019t know the basic business etiquettes.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t use &#8220;Dear Sir or Madam&#8221; if you don&#8217;t know the name of recruiter until you are from the 18<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> century.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Step 2: First Paragraph<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know a hiring manager receives hundreds of application in a day.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your cover letter should hook him right away to stand out on those hundreds of letters and applications.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And your first paragraph plays a major role in this.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are two examples showing two different types of cover letter for an internship.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>Incorrect Way<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<b><i>\u201c I would love to get this digital marketing internship opportunity.

In addition\u2026\u201d<\/i><\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is nothing wrong with this cover letter sample, but the letter is specifically written for the manager only.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, there is nothing new and innovative in it. Everyone applying for this internship role will promise to work hard. <\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Correct Way <\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<b><i>\u201c I was so excited that my profile is shortlisted for Digital Marketing Intern Role.<\/i><\/b>\r\n<b><i>It was no accident.

And the second tells a convincing story of why you\u2019re best for this position.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Step 3: Paragraph 2<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A company will hire you if they see something unique in you. You should prove to them that this organization is best for you and how your skill sets can contribute to the organization\u2019s growth.<\/span>\r\n<b>Now let\u2019s look at the examples:<\/b>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Incorrect way:<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<b><i>\u201c I did very well in training program.

You are showing that how your digital marketing skills are relevant and beneficial for the organization. <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Step 4: Paragraph 3<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your first paragraph explains why you are perfect the job.
