Creating these lists at night prior to bed is a great use of time.\u00a0 It is a simple task to accomplish, and it does not take time away from your core work hours during the day.\r\n\r\nIt does, however, allow an advisor to get things on paper for the day or week ahead.\u00a0 The same can be done for those who prefer to get up early and take a short amount of time to work on their lists.\r\n\r\nSitting and enjoying a cup of coffee while working on the to-do list for the week ahead is a great use of time and allows an advisor to work on attracting new clients. They can then use that core time during the day to put those plans into place.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Constructive Feedback is Good<\/h3>\r\nThat may be a difficult pill to swallow, but it is true.\u00a0 There are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210218064557\/https:\/\/personalexcellence.co\/blog\/why-criticism-is-good\/\">several reasons constructive feedback can actually help<\/a>\u00a0grow and maintain a client base.\u00a0 One of the biggest things with this type of feedback is the ability of a financial advisor to see things from a different perspective.\r\n\r\nThis may allow you to rework a plan in place for a client or to make long-term improvements that can benefit many other clients.\u00a0 It is about improvement; as times change, it is important to roll with changes. Adaptability can mean longevity in the financial advisory world.\r\n\r\nFeedback can also be a great way to motivate someone.\u00a0 If a client gives you feedback that a certain task is taking longer than they expected it to be completed, this may result in the advisor getting a motivational boost to get up and going to accomplish the task at hand.\r\n\r\nAs a possible positive result of this added motivation source, the client can potentially share with other prospective clients how the advisor listened to the concerns, made adjustments, and as a result \u2013 felt heard and valued.\u00a0 Again, constructive feedback can work to your advantage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Be a Social Butterfly<\/h3>\r\nIt is not okay to accept the belief that if someone is really interested in having someone as their advisor, the potential client will always reach out first.\u00a0 This is why, in order to attract and then keep new clients, a financial advisor must always be visible in a social way.\r\n\r\nThere are many different methods and mediums to accomplish this.\u00a0 First, when contacting people, if an advisor does not speak directly with the client, always leave a message.\u00a0 It helps to convey the importance of the call, and it also tells the client you are focused on them.\r\n\r\nAnother way to keep the lines of communication open is through the mail.\u00a0 This does not mean standard mailings and flyers. Get to know the client \u2013 their interests, passions, and more \u2013 and send them mail that is tailored to their own interests.\u00a0 Again, this shows the client that you are paying attention to the small details in their lives.\r\n\r\nIf an advisor can pick up on small, social details, imagine the detail and planning that would be put into financial services through this advisor.\u00a0 For the ultimate cherry on top, go with a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210218064557\/https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/strategy\/the-power-of-handwritten-notes-in-business-02279876#:~:text=Writing%20a%20handwritten%20note%20is,time%20to%20meet%20their%20needs.\">hand-written note or letter to clients<\/a>.\u00a0 Yes, it might be easier to type something, print it, and sign it, but when someone makes the effort to handwrite something to a client, nothing can beat that.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Get Out of Your Comfort Zone: Try Something New<\/h3>\r\nDo not be afraid to try something new.\u00a0 If things were perfect as-is, that would mean you would have a successful, wide-reaching financial advisory with a strong foundation of long-term clients and a steady trail of new clients as well.\u00a0 However, that is not the case.\u00a0 Taking the time to step outside of your comfort zone can have a big payoff in the end.\r\n\r\nStart simple.\u00a0 Build on the knowledge of what works and does not work.\u00a0 Also, do not expect changes overnight.\u00a0 Be patient.\u00a0 Know that with the dedication to revised plans and the execution of them, attracting and maintaining new clients is within your reach.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]All financial advisors want to find new clients.\u00a0 Not only do they want to find the clients, but they also want them to be their clients for the long term.\u00a0 Taking the time to do some research, and try&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":34634,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[32,37],"tags":[40],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 -
