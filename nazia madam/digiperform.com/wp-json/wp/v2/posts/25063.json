Your professors tackled digital marketing in general, and you learned a lot. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there weren\u2019t any SEO scholars there to prepare you for a <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/how-career-in-digital-marketing-will-shine-in-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">career in the digital marketing industry<\/a>. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization is such a complex process that it\u2019s hard to tackle in a college course. There aren\u2019t definite rules, and the practices are ever-changing. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why professors don\u2019t like to cover it, and it\u2019s why universities don\u2019t educate SEO scholars.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, it\u2019s possible to get into an SEO career right after college. You\u2019ll have to learn a lot and practice different techniques. You\u2019ll experiment with trial and error, too! However, you\u2019ll be entering an interesting field that shapes the digital marketing industry for the most part.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only question is: <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/how-to-get-a-job-in-seo-as-a-fresher\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how do you get an SEO specialist job right after graduation<\/a>?<\/span>\r\n<h1><strong>7 Ways to Get a Job in SEO after College Graduation<\/strong><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>1# Make Sure This Is What You Want<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many recent graduates aspire to SEO positions because they can easily get into freelancing and there are many open positions on the <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/digital-marketing-jobs-career-opportunities-for-fresher-in-india\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital marketing job market<\/a>. But they don\u2019t love SEO as a profession. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fter a while, they realize it\u2019s too \u201ctechnical\u201d and they don\u2019t find it exciting.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you start applying for positions, you\u2019ll need to get deeper into the learning experience. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn as much as possible and work on your own projects. These initial steps should be enough for you to figure out: Is this the career part you want to pursue?<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constant challenges are part of SEO. Nothing is final. You\u2019ll always have new things to learn and new techniques to try. For many recent graduates, that sounds like an exciting opportunity. Others find it overwhelming. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another great thing about SEO is that ideas matter. If you have amazing ideas and you perform well, the years of experience won\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll make progress!\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest problem with this career is the work-life balance. It\u2019s a hard thing to achieve since SEO is not something you do as a 9-to-5 job. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some hiring managers will consider you because you\u2019re young and they assume you have a lot to give. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will expect you to be constantly online and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> accept extra tasks when necessary. SEO is done on weekends, on holidays, and during summer vacations. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not that great at time management, the job will suck the life out of you. However, having so many opportunities to work is also a good thing. You&#8217;ll just need to set your limits.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>2# Learn at Your Own Pace<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you graduate from college and start thinking about a career in digital marketing, your first thought will be: \u201cI need to get an SEO certification.\u201d Don\u2019t go there! It\u2019s not necessary to hold a certificate. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes; a certificate is good because you get it after a structured program that teaches you something. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn from legit experts, who know what they are talking about. It also proves that you mastered SEO skills up to a certain level.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, certification programs have their downsides as well. They don\u2019t emphasize practice; they emphasize education. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you already tool marketing courses at university, your degree should be enough to prove your education. Employers are after the experience, so to <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/how-to-get-a-digital-marketing-job-as-a-fresher\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get a job in the digital marketing industry<\/a> you should focus on that.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you learn? You\u2019ll find amazing online resources that give you the knowledge you need. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/beginners-guide-to-seo\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Beginner\u2019s Guide to SEO<\/span><\/i><\/a> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Moz and <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/seths.blog\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seth Godin\u2019s blog<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. From there on, it will be easy to identify the experts in the digital marketing industry and learn from them. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But remember: it\u2019s not just about learning. It\u2019s mostly about the practice, and that brings us to the next point.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>3# Focus on Essential SEO Skills<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginner level, a hiring manager will ask if you can do these things:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage and analyze websites through Search Console<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Google Tag Manager<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Google Analytics<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand Google\u2019s search operators<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perform on-page and off-page SEO<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write optimized content<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build links that would improve the search engine rankings<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a crawler tool<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find and fix indexed error pages<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor the results of an SEO campaign and adjust the strategy accordingly<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a lot. No one said this would be easy. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you start learning, focus on these essential skills that you\u2019ll definitely need for employment in the sector.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>4# Get Some Experience through Your Own Project<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll need something feature in your resume and LinkedIn profile. You can\u2019t apply to an ad for an SEO job without any previous experience.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll have to start your own website. It can be about anything you like; just choose a niche you feel passionate about. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, focus on search engine optimization. Your goal is to get your site featured in Google\u2019s first suggestions on a relevant quest.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re already guessing: there\u2019s a lot of learning to cover before you get to that step. It\u2019s not easy to beat your entire competition and end up on the first page of results. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember those services you turned to when you were thinking \u201cI <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/edubirdie.com\/write-my-essay\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need someone to write me an essay<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d? You can work with those writers again. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll give them the ideas and keywords, and they will develop good content for you.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just about keywords and content, though. It\u2019s about finding the right topics, targeting the right keywords, and maintaining the right balance in your posting schedule. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO is a lot of work, so stay committed to it. Once you make your website successful, you\u2019ll have something to show off. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any recruiter will be willing to consider you as part of their marketing team.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>5# Choose Your Specialty\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An SEO specialist<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a broad term.

You\u2019ll stand out between applicants with general experience.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>6# Start Applying<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have the needed knowledge and some experience to showcase in your application, you can get on the job market. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most beginners decide to start with freelancing platforms, such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upwork<\/span><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/airtasker.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airtasker<\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peopleperhour.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PeoplePerHour<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are a decent source of opportunities, especially for entry-level positions in marketing teams. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re good enough, you can keep collaborating with returning clients outside the platform, and aim for a higher position in their team.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, LinkedIn should remain your major focus. It\u2019s where recruiters search for candidates. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get noticed in discussion groups, and you can post your own content. Present yourself as an expert in the industry!<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>7# You\u2019re Just a Beginner, So Don\u2019t Get Greedy<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.payscale.com\/research\/US\/Job=Search_Engine_Optimization_(SEO)_Analyst\/Salary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PayScale<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the median pay for SEO analysts is $49,263 per year. Senior analysts earn much more (around $70K). <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re just a beginner, you can\u2019t aim for such high amounts. You have college loans to pay off, rent to pay, and a life to live.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You might think that $37K per year is too low, but keep in mind that it\u2019s just a start. It\u2019s your chance to prove what you know and gain experience through your first job.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you combine an entry-level job with freelancing activities, you\u2019ll earn more money and tons of experience that will get you to a better position.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many recent graduates offer their SEO services for free at the beginning. They find a small startup that hasn\u2019t developed an SEO strategy yet. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They contact the owner, offering a project that\u2019s free for a month. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the owner sees the results, they will want to collaborate. Even if they don\u2019t sign a contract, they will give you a great recommendation for a job well done.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t keep working for free forever, but it\u2019s something to consider if you\u2019re not getting job interviews right from the start.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h1><strong>SEO Is a Great Career Choice!<\/strong><\/h1>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO is nowhere near its end.
