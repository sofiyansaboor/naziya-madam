The social network has long been criticized for not being transparent about how it decides when content violates its community standards, an example you can see in the video below:<\/span>\r\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0vL4HLTZQ_Q\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>)\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being baffled by the voices; Facebook broke out new guidelines for content moderation with an effort to restore goodwill with its users. Facebook broke out those guidelines into six topics: <\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">violence and criminal behavior; <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safety; <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">objectionable content; <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">integrity and authenticity; <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">respecting intellectual property; <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and content-related requests.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/communitystandards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">27-page Facebook Content Review Guidelines<\/a> provides insight into the rationale Facebook uses to develop its standards which will balance users\u2019 safety. Also, it will save the right to free expression while maintaining a sufficiently sanitized platform for advertisers. In the same context, the Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said that the publication of the guidelines was a step toward his personal goal &#8211; to develop a more democratic and independent system for determining Facebook\u2019s Community Standards.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In continuation to same, the company has banned all kind of content related to terrorist organizations and hate groups, for example, but the document reveals how Facebook actually defines such groups. The Facebook has already started eradicating this type of content which has leashed out as Hate by many social media users. They have also faced backlash for removing content without providing any recourse for users who posted that content. However, good news that Facebook will now provide those users with a way to <\/span><b>Appeal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the social network\u2019s decisions on individual posts. Yes, you have head it right. You can make an appeal for your posts.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>How this appeal process works:<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While removing your post or picture from the status bar, you will be provided with a description \u00a0of how the new appeals process will work:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your photo, video or post has been removed because we found that it violates our community standards, you will be notified and given the option to request an additional review.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will lead to a review by our team (will be handled manually by the person), typically within 24 hours.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we\u2019ve made a mistake, we will notify you and your post, photo or video will be restored.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The appeals process will start off with posts that were removed for nudity or sexual activity, hate speech or graphic violence or any type of content that can lead to violence. Facebook has declared that in their Facebook\u2019s Content Policy Team, there will be 11 officers worldwide, including experts on topics such as hate speech, child safety, and terrorism. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of these guidelines is too &#8211; first, to help people to understand where they need to draw the line on nuanced issues or statements; second &#8211; these guidelines will give an arena to improve and be acceptable by all. By providing these details makes it easier for everyone, including experts in different fields to give us feedback so that Facebook can improve the guidelines and the decisions that they can make over time.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Facebook\u2019s appeals process and community operations team include more than 7,500 content reviewers\u2014up over 40 percent year over year\u2014and it is working 24 hours per day, seven days per week, in more than 40 languages.<\/span> Along with that, with time they will be sharing required changes or updates publicly and will be releasing a searchable archive so that people can track changes over time.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Facebook Content Review Guidelines, you can go to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/communitystandards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link<\/a>\u00a0and be stick to the policy.
