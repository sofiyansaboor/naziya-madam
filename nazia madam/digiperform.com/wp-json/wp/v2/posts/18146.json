Or, they may lack knowledge about automation. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in reality, automation makes it easier for you to keep track of your customers&#8217; activity. It gives more personalization to your email marketing campaigns and it&#8217;s more effective for the long run as well.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Why is an automated email marketing campaign important for any business?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some great pointers for automating your email campaigns:<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Show personal care to your audience<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best point of email marketing automation is that it gives the 24X7 advantage to stay in touch with your clients without any burden of manpower. As per campaign protocol, you can send relevant emails\/replies on time. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a subscriber has just joined for free services to have a free trial test of your product. With your regular updates and assistance, your same free subscriber can turn into paying customers. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same in the case of e-commerce, if one has landed upon your website and joined your email newsletter. Your regular updates regarding sales or discounts can turn the same customer into paying one. As the sales and discounted emails will interest him\/her and lead to purchase any item as well. <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Save Time<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who doesn\u2019t like to save time? When it comes to business emails, it&#8217;s not easy to update or rewrite each email and send it to the subscriber. if you feel like to do so, you may need the hell of manpower to complete just messages and replies. Automation helps to save your time in this case. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than wasting time replying to each mail, it&#8217;s important to utilize the same time to design content for your upcoming email campaign or creating more email marketing strategies for your business. After you build the automation it unfolds by itself and you can spend your time on other things. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you need to do is monitor your campaigns time after time, analyze reports and review the emails that are not bringing the desired results. Don\u2019t forget to optimize your campaigns by A\/B testing.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Grow Your Revenue Faster<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you plan your email marketing strategy with automation, you can expect tremendous results in terms of revenue as well. Because when you will be seriously sending emails to your customers\/subscribers, there will be high chances to increase your click as well as open rate. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By tracking your click-open through rates and other actions, marketers can analyze which are the most interesting campaigns so far and how much they have generated leads or sales. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquiring a new lead is more expensive than generating on your own. Also, with automation, you can encourage your existing customers to shop more. It is no surprise that most marketers are interested in upselling. This will get easier to do with a behavior-based automation series (history) which will suggest your existing, as well as new customers, buy more products.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you may have seen how big e-commerce companies like eBay and Amazon are doing this by sending you similar products to the ones you already purchased. This is a great example of automation that is determined by the customer\u2019s purchase history.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Organize Your Campaigns<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ideal way to start any content-centric campaign is by creating an email marketing calendar. With the organized calendar, you will be more sorted and can look your campaign at a bigger picture. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automation is a great help for any planning enthusiast because it lets you stick to the plan even when you are busy doing other things. Just prepare and schedule the content and the campaign will work itself out.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Maintain Brand Personality<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email marketing helps in maintaining the channel of communication between the brand and its customers. With automation, these possibilities increase ten folds. Automation helps to draft better emails and act as a voice for your brand. It conveys a better message to the prospects and reinforces the brands\u2019 values. <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Measure Your Email Marketing Campaigns\u2019 Results<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a general email marketing campaign, automation also helps to have an overview of how many emails are opened? Which emails generated more leads? Which parts of the campaign can be improved through A\/B testing? Etc. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email marketing tools allow you to monitor who is opening what, how many emails are bounced, and track all email activity for Key Performance Indicators (KPI\u2019s).<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have integrated your campaign with Google Analytics, you can analyze your data and see automatically where the leads come from, how they converted, etc.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your email marketing campaign analytics can teach you about your subscribers\u2019 behavior by showing the content they are most interested in. In other words, analytics let you evaluate what content attracts people to your products or services, which converts them to leads, and what convinces them to buy. Evaluate your marketing performance, adjust your future initiatives and reach your goals in a more cost-effective and time-saving way!<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>How to create automated emails? <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After understanding the importance and usage of the automated email marketing campaign, it necessary to know how to create an automated email marketing campaign.
