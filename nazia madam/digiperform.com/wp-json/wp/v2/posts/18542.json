Let\u2019s start with step by step to understand influencer marketing with our free beginner&#8217;s guide to influencer marketing. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here we go!<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>What is Influencer Marketing?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Influencer_marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Influencer Marketing<\/a> is a type of marketing that aims to grab attention by using influential people to amplify a brand\u2019s message and project it to a given audience.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simple words, instead of marketing the product or services directly to the audience, the brands would hire, pay or incentivize a person of social influence to review, name-drop or associate with the brand.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, the small-scaled brands are using influential stand-up comedians to promote their products like the way <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/interview-session-souled-store-founders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Souled Store<\/a> collaborated with Stand-up comedian Kenny Sebastian and AIB to promote their funky t-shirts in the respective audience.<\/span>\r\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-12.07.22-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18546 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-12.07.22-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"358\" height=\"418\" \/><\/b><\/a><\/h2>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Why is Influencer Marketing Effective?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a basic level, marketing is all about getting your message delivered to your audience or tied in with getting your plans to spread it. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, broad communications (or advertising) was the favored strategy to accomplish these finishes. But now the ways have tuned into web directions.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best part of influencer marketing that helps brands to reach out to the local audience. An influencer can decide in what way they want to promote the product in their audience. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the audience looks for genuine reviews that can be related to them personally. Therefore influencer marketing comes very handy for brands if they want to target genuine customers. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When brands get influencer marketing right, they reap big returns. Consider these statistics:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter users report a 2X increase in purchase intent when exposed to promotional content from influencers.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencer marketing content delivers 11X higher ROI than traditional forms of digital marketing.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On average, businesses generate $6.50 for every $1 invested in influencer marketing.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Who are the Influencers?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people think about influencers, they naturally imagine some top celebrity-type figures or TV actors. But influencers don\u2019t necessarily have to be celebrities. They can be lifestyle followers, comedians, bloggers, industry experts, etc. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They do, however, usually specialize in a particular niche and typically benefit from a large following on social media.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of social influencers come in the form of:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Journalists<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academics<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Industry Experts<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloggers\/Vloggers<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides being influential to a lot of people, influencers are often different from the general public by the way in which they adopt new ideas and innovations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_18548\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18548\" style=\"width: 567px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-18548\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/inlfu.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"567\" height=\"319\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-18548\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From R to L: Ranveer Singh, Malini Aggarwal, and Vir Das<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, \u00a0as you know the basic of influence marketing, there is much more than you can learn to follow the path of this industry. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our continuation parts, you will be learning how you can become a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.g2.com\/glossary\/influencer-analytics-definition\">social media influencer<\/a> and how to create your influencer marketing strategy? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you get to know these, then how to send your first pitch as an influencer and what are the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of influencer marketing?
