Researches have confirmed that the number of people reading emails on mobile devices is growing more than the number of people reading emails on desktops. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, there are a set of rules that any marketer or businessman should follow to bring out the best emails for mobile devices. <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Rules to follow<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep the text content as simple and short to the point. People don\u2019t like to spend much time reading emails. Most of them will just scan the message looking for something interesting or worthwhile so limit your text content to things that will hold attention.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use subtitles and a single-column layout.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t forget to include prominent call-to-action buttons. These buttons will help you to turn your subscribers into the lead to conversion no matter what platform they use to access your emails.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note to Remember: \u00a0Anyone reading your email is using a significantly smaller screen than those using a laptop. Therefore, it\u2019s important to structure your message to be easily understood.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Typical characteristics for messages designed for mobile devices<\/b><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Large font sizes<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good size for section titles is 30px but 22px is an absolute minimum. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Text in the body of the message should use at least 14px.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A single-column format<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single-column designs of not more than 520px work best for mobile devices. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are easier to read for subscribers and less likely encounter display problems.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>A minimum clickable area of 44px x 44px<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major part to Remember is that mobile users don\u2019t have a mouse to help them click on things. They just have their finger to interact with your message. And, the finger needs a certain amount of space to click on anything. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommended size for such an area is 44px x 44px but it could be as small as 44px high by 29px wide. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t forget that an empty space of at least 10px should surround clickable icons to make them stand out.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Clearly visible clickable elements<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/493_big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18046 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/493_big.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"307\" height=\"437\" \/><\/a>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clickable icons such as Call to Actions; should be graphically prepared, placed on solid color backgrounds and be labeled with proper action like \u201cBuy Now\u201d, \u201cRead More\u201d, &#8220;Shop Now&#8221;, etc. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make it easy for readers to understand and navigate your email since they don\u2019t have a mouse to tell them if a call to action is clickable or not.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Pay attention to your pre-header text<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first focus goes to the header of your emails. First, it is necessary to contain the motto of your email in the heading itself. Secondly, try to keep it short and crispy. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-header text, meanwhile, is often overlooked though equally important! <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, do not forget to personalize the heading as well. Personalization is critical to the success of email marketing. \u00a0An ideal marketer should be encouraged to implement it within their email.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Use a responsive template<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-18234 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/mobileem.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"379\" height=\"393\" \/><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re using a pre-designed template from your email service provider or email marketing tool, make sure it&#8217;s responsive. You will find the number of mobile responsive email templates that are designed to automatically fit the screen on which they&#8217;re being viewed.
