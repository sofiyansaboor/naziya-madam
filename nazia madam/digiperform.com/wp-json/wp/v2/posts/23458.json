In simple words, <em><strong>keywords are those terms that people will search for on the search engines to seek answers.<\/strong><\/em><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any business becomes successful by providing people with the information, products, and services they need. Keyword research will present you with opportunities to better understand the right kind audience for your business. It will help you answer questions like,<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are people searching for?<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many people are searching for it?<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What type of information they are seeking?<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h4><b>Discovering Keywords and Search Volume\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a few keywords in mind which you\u2019d like to rank for, that\u2019s great! These could be the products or services you offer. These are the seed keywords to kick off the research process in the right direction. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter these keywords into the Keyword Research tools to get insight into the search volume and related keywords. The related keywords can give you an idea about the keyword variations.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s consider an example of a clothing brand which deals in sportswear.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you type in \u201csports\u201d and \u201cClothing\u201d in the research tool, you may discover highly relevant and highly searched keywords such as,<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swimming trunks<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gym shorts<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Track pants<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you discover keywords, you may notice the search volume varies greatly. Though you definitely could go with highly searched keywords, the competition is also high. Also, keywords with low search volume are advantageous as they have less competition and covert quickly.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both high and low search volume keywords can be advantageous. Looking at the search volumes, you are at a better position to decide which keywords to prioritize that will give your website the biggest strategic advantage.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h4><b>Focus on Long-Tail Keywords<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, the search queries that people put in the search engines can often be of three types \u2013 Informational, Navigational, and Transactional. These are categorized based on the intent with which the user is searching on the web.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Informational queries constitute a situation where the user needs some information such as \u201chow long is the river Nile\u201d or \u201cwhat is the population of India\u201d. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the user wishes to go to a certain website, like say \u201cYouTube\u201d, it falls into the navigational queries. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this section, we will focus on the third category, the transactional queries. This constitutes the buying phase where the users have already researched for the products\/services they are interested in and is ready to buy or make a transaction.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-tail keywords are very specific three to four words phrases that users search for with the intent of buying the products or services you offer. Most of the time, these specific searches will result in sales than generic searches that tend to be towards the research phase before making a buying decision.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, even if the search volume of the generic queries is 10000 a month, it is only a fraction of all the searches performed on the internet. Keywords with a very high search volume may present users with ambiguous content. However, Low volume and very specific keywords present users with exactly what they need and help you to convert them.<\/span>\r\nRead More: <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/how-to-create-your-keyword-strategy-for-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to create your Keyword Strategy for SEO?<\/a>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>On-page SEO<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have discovered, prioritized and decided the keywords your target market is searching for, it is the time to use those keywords in the web pages on the website. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best practice would be to optimize the content on each of the web pages, focusing on a particular keyword, as every keyword has a different intent and answers for your website visitors.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Title Tags<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title tags are the HTML element that is descriptive and specifies the title of the webpage. Each of the web page on the website should have a unique title tag. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the first thing visible to the users on the search engines. Title tags are important as it casts the first impression on the users.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ultimate recipe for the title tags include,<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Keyword usage<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In practice, the target keywords should be at the start of the Title. This helps the search engines and users to understand what the page is all about.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Length<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, search engines show <strong>50 to 60<\/strong> characters of the title in the search results. However, do not limit the title to the strict character count if hampers the readability.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Branding<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a brand, it is a good means to fuel the brand awareness effort. Including the brand name at the end of the title make people acquainted with your brand and increases the click-through rate if it is a well-known brand.<\/span>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screenshot-2019-08-07-at-6.10.55-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-23666 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Screenshot-2019-08-07-at-6.10.55-PM.png\" alt=\"On Page And Off Page SEO\" width=\"584\" height=\"566\" \/><\/a><\/h3>\r\n<h4><b>Meta Descriptions<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meta-description plays a very important role in the strategy. It\u2019s an opportunity to write a description that summarizes the title.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Good Meta-description increases the chances of the user clicking and visiting your business. The more the CTR (Click-through rate), the greater the chance of the people using services or buying products that you offer.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said since search engines display first <strong>150 &#8211; 166<\/strong> characters of the description, it is advisable to keep it under that limit. Also, include your target keywords in the Meta description to give it more value from users\u2019 and search engine\u2019s perspective.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Content<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actual content on a web page is what provides value by answering the user\u2019s questions. It is important as different types of content have different roles to play. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Say, a web page with content for SEO strategies will help users in a certain way than a web page with customer care related content.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you create the content, it is advisable to refrain from using low-value tactics such as,<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b>Thin and Duplicate content<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a piece of content on a web page, there is no magic number for word count. The most important factor to consider is to account for the intent behind creating that web page. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just incorporating the keywords and writing a very short content won\u2019t work. Search engines today give more weight to relevance for the users than themselves. So, creating the content just for search engines by ignoring user questions will land you in trouble.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, duplicating the content on multiple web pages is not advisable. For example, suppose you have a website for sportswear. You have created two web pages for \u201cswimming costume\u201d and \u201cswimming trunks\u201d. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the web pages are optimized for different keywords, the content will essentially be the same. Tactics like these are not helpful for the user, and as Google specifically stresses on this factor, you could be penalized.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b>Cloaking<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloaking is a practice of presenting users and search engines with different content. According to the search engine\u2019s guidelines, the content on the website should be visible to both the users and the search engines alike. Websites do this by hiding the text in HTML just for the sake of search engines and the users are not able to see this content.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b>Keyword Stuffing<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inserting a large number of keywords in the web content and Meta description to rank higher in the search results is termed as keyword stuffing. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could be done in many ways, such as matching the font color to the background, setting font size to zero and hiding the keywords behind an image. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is an unethical SEO technique and if caught your website could be penalized and de-indexed from the search results. Moreover, any users visiting your site will not stay for long due to the absence of relevant content.<\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4><b>Alt Text<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alt text is an HTML element that provides alternative text to the images on a web page. This image markup technique can not only impact the way search engines perceive your web page but it also helps you to generate traffic from an image search on the search engines.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It increases web accessibility as search engine crawlers are not able to crawl the images (.jpeg, .png, etc.) on a web page. Providing Alt text also helps visually impaired people to understand what the image depicts through the screen readers.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The important point to note here is that you should not stuff keywords while providing the alt text as it hampers the relevance of images for search engines.<\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4><b>URL Structure<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">URL stands for \u201cuniform resource locator\u201d. Every web page on the website has a unique address known as a URL. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the most direct way for someone to visit a page on the website. As the title and Meta description, the URL is also shown in the search engine results.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A URL mentioning a clear path to the web page is helpful for the users who are trying to understand what a specific URL is all about. Consider a website which sells dessert. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be individual web pages for say \u201capple pie\u201d and \u201cfruit custard\u201d. In this case, the best URL structure would be \u201cexample.com\/dessert\/apple-pie\u201d and \u201cexample.com\/dessert\/fruit-custard\u201d. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, if someone is looking to buy fruit custard, the user is in a better position to click the related URL.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Information Architecture and the Power of Links<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information architecture is a concept of how you organize different pages on your website. In response to the searches performed on the search engines, the way pages are organized and inter-linked on the website has a tremendous impact.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With well-planned information architecture, search engines can better understand what a page is about and how important it is. Search engines perceive links as the \u201cvotes of confidence\u201d.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Internal Links<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal linking is a practice of linking different pages of the same domain. In layman\u2019s term, an internal link is one that points to another page on the same website. Internal links are useful for three main reasons,<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They allow users to navigate a website in the best possible way.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They help to establish information hierarchy for the given website.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They help search engines to spread link juice among websites. Consider a website that deals with car performance chips. External domains link to a particular page on the website providing information on how the performance chips work. The other page on the website is sales-related which receive comparatively less number of external links. Now, if the informative page links to the sales-related page, it is a signal to the search engines that the sales page has authority because it is linked to the page with more authority.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4><b>External Links<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as inbound links or backlinks are HTML hyperlinks that point from one website to another. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backlinks are the currency of the internet. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you visit a town and you ask three people what the best restaurant in that town was, and they all said, \u201cNanking\u201d, you\u2019ll feel confident that it indeed is the best restaurant. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is exactly what backlinks do for the search engines. If a good quality of links points to your website, search engines know that your website is authoritative and it helps to improve the rank of the website in the search results. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplistic step-by-step way to build backlinks to your website,<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conduct audience research and study about the audience in your niche.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a list of websites which are related to your niche and appeal to your audience.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explore the type of information the audience on these sites wishes to consume.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craft a well-written piece of content including your target keywords.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to the website owners.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h4><b>Follow and No-follow Links<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give you an idea of how powerful the links are, when a web page gets an inbound link, which is a hyperlink pointing to that page from another website, it helps to boost the SEO. Consider a link as one point (Link juice), the more points you get the more it is beneficial to rank higher.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have learned how external links work, we can define the follow and no-follow links. Follow links are those links that pass the link juice to the website they are pointing to. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No-follow links, on the other hand, does not pass the link juice. No-follow links tell the search engines not to follow the links. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some search engines still follow the \u201cno-follow\u201d links to simply discover new pages but does not contribute towards boosting the SEO.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Additional SEO Parameters<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main factor for ranking higher in the search results in SEO has been link building until now. With time, as the search engines are becoming more intelligent, they have started to give importance to a lot of small but important parameters. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, the strategies for SEO differ for different businesses. But, there are some common factors everyone should pay attention to. These common factors include,<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Page Speed<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simple words, users\u2019 interest to remain on a page is inversely proportional to the page load time. The lesser the time your page takes to load the more probability of people spending more time on the website. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies reveal that 53% of people will leave a mobile page if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. Optimizing the page for speed includes identifying and optimizing the elements that take more time to load due to their size.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Mobile Friendliness<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, websites are experiencing most of the traffic from mobile devices. Since traffic from mobile devices outweighs the traffic from desktop, how \u2018mobile-friendly\u2019 your website is will have a huge effect on the website ranking.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>XML Sitemap<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">XML sitemaps help search engines understand your site and find all of its content. Submitting a page to the search engines in the sitemap does not mean that your page will rank in the search results. Consider it as a door to your site where search engines can decide for how to rank that page. You can create your own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xml-sitemaps.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google XML sitemap online<\/a> as well.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>In Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congratulate! Yourself for getting this far. Now, with our free beginner&#8217;s guide to SEO marketing, you have learned how search engines rank websites and the techniques that help you rank higher in the search results.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, no site can do a perfect job of executing all the aspects of SEO. \u201cJack of all trades and master of none\u201d goes for SEO too. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify and prioritize the strengths of your site and use the budget optimally.
