It has a very broad concept. Like, it includes how many of your subscribers opened your emails, how many emails got bounced, how many have reached to the right audience, and so on. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before measuring the effectiveness of your email campaign, you need to clear your ultimate goals for your email marketing campaign. There is no point to create the campaigns if you don\u2019t know what are your goals and how you even begin working on strategy, execution and reporting. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But don\u2019t worry!

The success of the email campaign opens or clicks within the email. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We, humans, get irritated easily whenever we see anything in abundance. Like if you are jammed up with \u2018n\u2019 number of emails, would you open each and every email? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess no! Then what about your email where you have shared your the launch of your product? You want your email to be unread or get into the trash. Of course No!<\/span>\r\n<b><i>\u201cThis is the reason why measuring opening or clicking rate is very important. Because of the volume of emails that an individual receives on a daily basis, using clicks or click-through rate, is a superior measure of effectiveness.\u201d<\/i><\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emails are the backbone of any online marketing campaign.

Also, the opening and clicking email would suggest your effort is on the right track which can lead to an impact on your organization&#8217;s ROI. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ideal marketer would determine the performance of an email campaign.

The percentage is called the open rate. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s an important metric to measure the effectiveness of your email marketing campaign. It helps to know that your subscribers are actually opening your email and reading them. <\/span>\r\n<b>How to Calculate: Total Opens \/ Emails Delivered<\/b>\r\n<b>When to Track: Weekly<\/b>\r\n<h2><b>Click-Through Rate<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is another important metric to determine the effectiveness of your email marketing campaign.

These rates give you a \u00a0percentage of how many times a link within the email is clicked versus how many messages were sent. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The click-through rate will always be equal to or less than the open rate because the user has to open your email in order to click any of the links.<\/span>\r\n<b>How to Calculate: Total Clicks \/ Emails Delivered<\/b>\r\n<b>When to Track: Weekly<\/b>\r\n<h2><b>Unsubscribe Rate<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-5.57.56-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-17741 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-5.57.56-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"726\" height=\"324\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many times when a marketer keeps on focussing on the number of increasing subscribers rather than focussing on unsubscribers. It\u2019s very important to keep an eye on your unsubscribed audience. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to look at common patterns why they are unsubscribing you or removing themselves from the list. The reason can be any; content, interest, favoritism (favorite brand), number of emails, etc. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just keep a track on the same and unsubscribe rate which is the percentage of your email recipients who clicked on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link inside your email due to XYZ reason. <\/span>\r\n<b>How to Calculate: Total Unsubscribes \/ Emails Delivered<\/b>\r\n<b>When to Track: Weekly<\/b>\r\n<h2><b>Conversion Rate<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-6.01.45-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-17744 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-6.01.45-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"221\" \/><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversion builds upon the effectiveness of open rate, click rate, and call to actions. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It determines that the user is responding and taking an action like purchasing your product, downloading brochure, etc; depending on what type of call to actions you have used in your email marketing campaign. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversion rate will always be the lowest of the three main measures because it requires the user to take the action you intend. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your conversion rate is the percentage of your email recipients who completed your desired action (e.g. purchasing a product).<\/span>\r\n<b>How to Calculate: Total Conversions \/ Emails Delivered<\/b>\r\n<b>When to Track: Monthly<\/b>\r\n<h2><b>Bounce Rate<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/bounce.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-17735 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/bounce.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"286\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most important parameter to decide how effective is your email marketing list.

We agree, subject lines are not easy to create but it is the first hurdle to work on if you want a successful email marketing campaign. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email subject lines help to determine the open rate. For a successful email campaign, design at least two different subject lines for your emails like as we do in A\/B testing and split your campaign for testing. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep things fresh and write some winners, keep these strategies in mind:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoke immediacy and excitement.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use words aligned with your brand.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember: People like to see their own names and even shout-outs to their cities.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use 50 characters or less\u2014that\u2019s all most mobile device displays can fit.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as you don\u2019t duplicate content online for SEO reasons, don\u2019t reuse subject lines, either.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is always a good practice to run A\/B tests on subject lines.

What is a UTM code? An Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) code refers to a snippet of simple code that\u2019s added to the end of a URL. UTMs are also called tracking tags because they allow you to track the origin of the website traffic.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary function of a UTM code is to track the performance of sales and marketing campaigns and the performance of web content. The URL parameters you can track include the source (root), medium (ways used), campaign (like email campaign), term, and content.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the good-to-know facts about UTM codes:\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) are regular Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), but with a maximum of five variables or parameters added, which are processed by Google Analytics.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; The source parameter tells you the website sending you traffic. For example, you can use a UTM code to your Facebook or Instagram page to track all traffic coming from your social media pages.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; To help improve your traffic, UTMs can be set up with other Analytics tools to generate relevant data. The corresponding data will be seen in your email campaigns, giving instant insight into the specific UTM code&#8217;s performance. Use a UTM code to determine the traffic coming from your email campaign, which reflects the effectiveness of your headlines and email content.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; While you can add the UTM parameters to your desired URL on your own, it\u2019ll take more time. You can use a trusted <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/utmstar.com\/utm-generator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UTM code generator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to generate the best UTM code you can use for your next email campaign.
