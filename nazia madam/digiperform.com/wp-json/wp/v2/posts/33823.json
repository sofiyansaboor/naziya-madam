Known as the smartphone generation, they\u2019re tech-savvy, avid social media users, and protective of the environment.\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the facts you should know about Gen Z to be able to understand them and get them excited about your brand.\u00a0<b>Consulting with a\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/branding-agency\"><b>branding agency<\/b><\/a><b>\u00a0might be a good idea to attract the post-millennial generation, but getting informed first is a must.<\/b>\u00a0In this guide, we\u2019ll explain six steps you should take to get Gen Z excited about your brand.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. Appeal To Gen Z By Showing That You Care<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGen Z is a caring generation, with the likes of Greta Tunberg being their voice for nature preservation, and ultimately, saving the planet.\u00a0<b>Marketing to these teens and adolescents shouldn\u2019t be flashy or flamboyant\u2014they prefer eco-friendly and ethical brands.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTreat the planet and your employees with respect and gratitude if you want to grab the attention of Gen Z. Your brand policy should be in line with these attitudes if you want to successfully grab Gen Z\u2019s attention.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>2. Have A Healthy Purpose<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMost businesses focus solely on the numbers and the income they make. That might be fine with some of the older generations, but the Gen Z population isn\u2019t so product or money-oriented. They prefer a brand that has a clear purpose and tries to make the world a better place.\r\n\r\n<b>If you show initiative to help your community, spread positivity, preserve nature, fight for those less fortunate, and stand up to social injustice, you\u2019ll look good in the eyes of everyone, especially younger generations.<\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>3. Interact With Them On Multiple Platforms<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGen Z is a very interactive generation, they are native to social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tik Tok, YouTube, Twitter, and more.\u00a0<b>Responding to your audience through these outlets can increase their interest and gain their loyalty.<\/b>\r\n\r\nYounger audiences are brand conscious and gladly flock to brands that are listening and catering to their needs. Loyalty is a two-way street, and you have to build it gradually but remember to maintain it throughout your brand expansion and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bid4papers.com\/blog\/educational-content-for-marketing\/\">marketing content<\/a>\u00a0for future success.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>4. Don\u2019t Patronize Or Lie To Gen Z<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBeing honest is not always easy, but if you want your brand to succeed, you\u2019ll have to be genuine and inspiring. False advertising doesn\u2019t sit well with anyone, but the older generation tends to succumb to it more than the younger ones.\r\n\r\n<b>Try to be relatable and personalize your communication with the Gen Z audience.<\/b>\u00a0It will go a long way if you treat them with respect and be upfront and honest.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>5. Focus On Mobile Users<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBaby boomers might have trouble adjusting to the tech era, but Gen Z is born in it. The majority of this population uses smartphones and tablets as their go-to digital devices. Many brands prioritize the desktop experience, but that shouldn\u2019t be the case anymore.\r\n\r\n<b>If you want to target younger users, make sure the\u00a0<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/capturly.com\/blog\/mobile-app-facts-for-a-great-ux\/\"><b>mobile experience is smooth<\/b><\/a><b>, fast, and optimal.<\/b>\u00a0Invest the same or higher amounts in the mobile version of your website \u2014 don\u2019t necessarily prioritize the desktop experience.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can hire a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designrush.com\/agency\/website-design-development\/illinois\/chicago\">Chicago web design company<\/a>\u00a0to help you out with this, if you\u2019re living in Chicago. There are companies that specialize in this all over the US, and employing industry-leading experts can surely help your brand.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>6. Cut Straight to the Point\u2014They Have Shorter Attention Spans!<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe digital era brought many benefits to brands across all industries. However, it also brought some flaws to the younger generations \u2014 their attention spans are very short,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iabuk.com\/opinions\/rise-short-form-video-gen-z-social-revolution\">around eight seconds<\/a>, which is four seconds shorter than the attentions of millennials.\r\n\r\nHow do you grab someone\u2019s attention in such a short period of time? There are a few schools of thought on this.\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to be creative and employ modern media methods whether using\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hunchads.com\/dynamic-creative\">Facebook ads<\/a>\u00a0or Instagram feeds to reach your audience. Most people are visual learners and prefer this medium, which also applies to Gen Z.\r\n\r\nSecond, you can try to offer an incentive for them to sign up for an email list of some sort.\u00a0 While they\u2019re typically weary of doing this, if you offer the right lead magnet it\u2019s possible to get them signed up.\u00a0 From there, use an email marketing platform\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/best-email-marketing-software-services\/\">from this list<\/a>\u00a0to deliver a ton of value over the course of a few weeks and then focus on your \u201cask\u201d.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, Gen Z likes extremely short videos, such as those featured in Instagram Reels or on Tik Tok.\u00a0<b>Adding these catchy videos to your website, within emails, or even better, reaching out to audiences on these dominant social media platforms, can be the key to grabbing their attention.<\/b>\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with using these apps, consider\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bookafy.com\/what-to-keep-in-mind-when-hiring-gen-z-flexibility-security-balance\/\">hiring Gen Z<\/a>\u00a0influencers to help you out. They can tag and showcase your brand, which is more likely to catch the attention of Gen Z than relying solely on your main website.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Parting Advice<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRemember that some of these tips will work better than the others because\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/797321\/us-population-by-generation\/\">Gen Z is a vast population with over 67 million people<\/a>\u00a0in the US alone. If you\u2019re considerate and put in the effort to personalize your brand toward Gen Z, you\u2019ll likely get their attention.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Author:<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Mathew Reeves<\/h4>\r\nExperienced in Online Marketing, Mathew writes for business and for pleasure, mostly focused on digital trends and web design.
