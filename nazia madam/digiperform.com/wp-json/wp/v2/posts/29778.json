The growth was noticeable for years, but the recent pandemic spurred things, even more, when more people had to do their shopping online. They also discovered the convenience of not leaving your home and still getting the goods or services.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, this growth invites more interested parties that would also like to get a share of the eCommerce pie. From individuals to well-established businesses, starting an eCommerce venture takes effort, particularly if you are entering a competitive niche.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar vein, it is also necessary to identify some of the trends that are affecting the industry so that you do not miss out on an important element when developing the business.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, you will find 6 examples of how various technologies and marketing methods are influencing one&#8217;s approach to working in the eCommerce industry.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>1. Customer Reviews<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s start with customer reviews. It is no secret that the available information from previous customers is one of the biggest benefits of shopping online. You are less likely to purchase the wrong item when you can read about the experience from other shoppers.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecommerce stores need to create a product review system and encourage shoppers to submit feedback. It is also recommended to import already available reviews if the business is based on the dropshipping model.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tools like Opinew, which can be considered a more advanced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.opinew.com\/opinew-vs-loox\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loox alternative<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as a better alternative to other similar tools, is a good way to hit the ground running with customer review import.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>2. Machine Learning\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Missing out on the benefits coming from machine learning can be detrimental to the success of an eCommerce business. Right now, more and more stores are investing in chatbots so that they can replace real humans in customer support.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A chatbot learns patterns and recognizes how to respond to a customer&#8217;s query immediately, and so long as it is working, a chatbot will be available 24\/7.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/machine-learning\/\">machine learning<\/a> is data processing. Because eCommerce businesses need to make significant decisions, they require actual numbers instead of random predictions. Collecting vast amounts of data and checking it manually is not efficient. Instead, it is better to leave the work to smart computer algorithms and see what they project.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>3. Virtual Reality<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual reality can solve one of the biggest drawbacks of shopping online. Because you cannot visit a store in person and try a product yourself, there is potential that you could end up spending the money, receiving the product, getting disappointed by it, and dealing with returns and refunds.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To eliminate these issues, some eCommerce businesses are investing in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/1\/8\/7514337\/ces-2015-state-of-virtual-reality\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual reality<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see if it pays off. Customers can put on VR goggles and explore an online store in a virtual environment that is akin to a brick-and-mortar shopping experience.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>4. Content Marketing<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since there is so much competition in eCommerce, investing in new marketing methods is a must to sustain a business. It is also important to note that if a method is working at one point, there are no guarantees that it will continue to be that way.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/content-marketing-tactics-every-marketer-should-know\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is emerging as one of the most effective techniques right now, particularly if there is personalization and visuals involved.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Messages to customers or potential partnerships are more likely to bear fruit if they include names, specific pain points, a video message, an infographic, or a Venn diagram, just to name a few.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blog posts, emails, and other types of content have their place, but it is better to emphasize creating visual-based content.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>5. Collaborations With Influencers<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/how-to-make-influencer-marketing-work-better-for-you\/\">Influencer marketing<\/a> is another example of an eCommerce trend that makes a significant impact. The whole thing became even more prominent when some of the most popular social media platforms introduced the shopping feature directly on their websites.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People follow celebrities and influencers and get attached to them over time. Therefore, they are more likely to purchase goods or services promoted by someone they like rather than by a random ad they encounter online.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers are making money for a reason, and eCommerce stores that fail to identify the benefit of such collaborations are bound to miss out on a lot of sales.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>6. Advanced Customization<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The freedom to decide what you want to purchase and how you want to modify it before spending money is a great advantage. Of course, this does not apply to every industry. If anything, the trend is somewhat narrow in the sense of how many businesses can offer the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/articles\/ecommerce\/ecommerce-trends\/\">advanced customization<\/a> feature, but it is still worth mentioning.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, print-on-demand businesses should let shoppers pick colors, fonts, where they want the design, what the quality and printing method should be, and so on. Limiting these options is a downside that leads to losing potential customers.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column offset=&#8221;vc_hidden-lg vc_hidden-md&#8221;][vc_raw_html]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[\/vc_raw_html][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]It should not come as a surprise to see the eCommerce industry growing at an exponential rate.
