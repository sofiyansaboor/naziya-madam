A market which was earlier targeting individuals of age group of 35+ has now seen this age bar falling by 5-8 years to 27+. Thanks to easy loan availability and better salaries in private sectors youngsters have started seeing real estate as not only an industry to get their dream home but also an investment opportunity giving returns as high as 20-25% annually. Most of these buyers are young couples living in technology towns &amp; are tech savvy.<\/p>\r\nBut only thing that real estate companies have failed to gauge is the approach pattern of these individuals towards buying homes. The research for a perfect real estate investment is not from Newspaper to property dealer\u2019s office now. People now interact with information on multiple channels before they make a decision. Here is a multiple touch point approach of a buyer they use both digital &amp; physical approaches while buying .\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Picture12.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-135\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Picture12.png\" alt=\"Multiple touch point approach\" width=\"867\" height=\"462\" \/><\/a>\r\nWhereas the real estate agents major focus is only visibility today, they forget the facts like engagement, reputation management &amp; retention are also the major parts of a buying cycle of user. As per one of the study 78% of buyers today carry an online research for reviews before making a purchasing decision.\r\nA time where the buyers seeks information &amp; education on home buying the major focus of developers today are still on cheap gimmicks like Free car on booking or booking a home at 101 Rs.\r\nGET A LIFE YOU REAL ESTATE MARKETERS&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; do you think that a Sales Head working in IT company looking for home or a Fashion Designer that sells a piece worth 2000 for 15000 plus can\u2019t sense your desperation to sell a property here. They are least bothered whether MS dhoni owns a house in their society or whether it\u2019s Aditya Birla. All that a buyer wants is a home that\u2019s build nicely, will be delivered on time and can offer them great returns. <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(Notice Dhoni&#8217;s IT Professional avatar below )<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/poor-Dhoni.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-136 aligncenter\" title=\"Real Estate Marketing traditional\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/poor-Dhoni.jpg\" alt=\"Dhoni marketing for real estate\" width=\"490\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\nIts not a rocket science to understand that if today\u2019s user is spending more time on digital channels then traditional one\u2019s that the real estate people should target them there. But if you still see the figures closely digital only accounts for 10-16% of their spends, even the major real estate developers don\u2019t have a dedicated team to manage the things in house. This digital ad spends are majorly burned in ad space buying.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/homes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-137 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/homes.jpg\" alt=\"Bad real estate advertising SEM\" width=\"584\" height=\"250\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\nIf you see the quality of ad copies that are not even good to sell a pen, forget homes. Look at the ads above google already offers limited characters but these guys can waste them all. Notice Apartments is the only abbreviation in 2<sup>nd<\/sup> Ad copy \ud83d\ude00 what else are they trying to sell.\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>So, what is the Right Digital Approach?<\/b><\/span>\r\n<b><\/b><b><\/b><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">1.<b> Understand your audience well:<\/b><\/span>\r\nUnderstand your audience, their problems, needs, key questions, platforms on which they spend time, how can they be made to visit your website and how your website will give them a solution to their immediate questions. Create a need of product rather than imposing it.\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Recently, I saw a campaign on digital and that\u2019s my personal favorite although its from mutual fund sector but in terms of approach it could be considered. <\/b><\/span>View campaign janotohmano.\r\n<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">2. <b>Hire a content team:<\/b><\/span>\r\nFuture of Marketing is all about content &amp; education and irony is content team is the last priority of any real estate organization. They are happier to pay per word or per article as they think content is only needed to make Google Happy but not their prospects.\r\n<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">3. <b>Create right landing pages: <\/b><\/span>\r\nCreate specific landing pages for different campaigns. A person buying a 2 BHK Home is totally different from person buying a Villa or a Penthouse you can\u2019t use a single page to target them both.\r\n<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">4. <b>Use effecting lead management software:<\/b><\/span>\r\nExcessive marketing leads to negativity. Don\u2019t call your prospects again and again till they stop taking your calls rather you should engage them properly using proper lead management software.\r\n<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">5. <b><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/digital-marketing-strategies-explode-business-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Invest into digital marketing strategy<\/a>: <\/b><\/span>What is panda?\r\nFor you it\u2019s an animal, ask a digital marketer the first thing he will say will be \u201cIt\u2019s an algorithm by Google\u201d. That\u2019s why few things should be left to subject experts. It\u2019s my suggestion to you to hire experts for building a strong digital strategy. It will take some money of yours but at least the approach towards execution will be accurate and will have more professionalism about it.\r\nYou can connect with me on linkedin for strategic help or mail at <a title=\"Vaibhav vats mail\" href=\"mailto:vaibhav@digiperform.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vaibhav@digiperform.com<\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"With the boom in Indian economy the purchasing power of Indian Real Estate buyer has taken a shift.
