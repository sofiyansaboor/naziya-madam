According to\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/content\/why-more-brands-should-leverage-d2c-model\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eMarketer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the D2C sales are expected to reach $174.98 billion by 2023. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to be a part of this D2C boom, you need to have a robust data-driven\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.affable.ai\/solutions\/e-commerce\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D2C influencer marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0strategy. In this article, we&#8217;ve listed a few strategies that you need to adopt to be on top of the game:<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>1. Audience segmentation<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s important that you use the information on your customers&#8217; interests, values, and shopping behavior to segment the audience. Customer segmentation helps you to reach new customers and new audiences. It also ensures that the right message reaches the right group of audience. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, it&#8217;s important for D2C brands to create content that aligns with customer values to create meaningful relationships. Moreover, strategic segmentation of the audience ensures marketing messages are customized to each audience&#8217;s needs and preferences. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This results in higher engagements and closer relationships.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>2. Partner with organic influencers<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with organic influencers for reviews and recommendations should be a part of your influencer marketing strategy.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic influencers are your greatest brand ambassadors for influencer marketing. They have genuinely used your products, and they have stories to tell their followers on what&#8217;s best about your products and why they should buy them.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>3. Personalize the customer experience<\/h4>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scalefast.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61% of consumers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0will willingly share more information with brands if it helps them to have a better customer experience.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D2C businesses rely heavily on digital channels to build relationships with their customers and to capture customer data. This data can help you personalize their experience, thus cementing the relationship and building loyalty.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>4. Choose the right influencer marketing channel<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s tempting to see your brand on every social media platform. But it may not be a wise strategy to invest in influencer marketing on every channel. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s because each social media channel is different, having its own unique features and user demographics. You cannot make the mistake of running your campaign on every platform; you&#8217;ll end up wasting your money and time.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you run an influencer marketing campaign on any social media channel, first learn about the platform&#8217;s features. Focus only on the channels that can connect with your audience and generate qualified leads.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few things worth considering when choosing the best social platform for your influencer marketing campaign:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the social channel&#8217;s audience demographics align with your target audience?<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the price range within your influencer marketing budget?<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the content format demonstrate your brand and product effectively?<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>5. Avoid making costly influencer investment mistakes<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s very common to get entangled with the wrong influencers for your influencer marketing campaigns. If you lack a data-driven influencer marketing strategy, you are more likely to make these common investment mistakes:<\/span>\r\n<h4>Misaligned Investment-<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing an influencer who is not aligned with your brand&#8217;s goals. Common examples of misaligned investment are:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poor audience quality<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mismatched audience demographics, and<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">below-average engagement.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Poor Audience Quality-<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in an influencer with fake followers.<\/span>\r\n<h4>Brand Safety Risks-<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partner with an influencer<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who can potentially harm your brand and create customer backlash.<\/span>\r\n<h4>Misaligned Audience Demographics-<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing an influencer whose audience doesn&#8217;t align with your buyer&#8217;s demographics.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h4>Under Investing in an Influencer-<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underpaying an influencer who can be an over performer for your brand.<\/span>\r\n<h4>Over Investing in an Influencer-<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overcompensating an influencer without looking at the impact the influencer drives for your brand.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology can help you make the right influencer marketing decisions. With the help of a data-driven influencer marketing platform, you can choose the right influencers, take control of your influencer marketing spend, understand the performance of your investments, optimize your returns and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appclonescript.com\/creating-successful-influencer-marketing-campaign\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create a successful influencer marketing campaign<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>AUTHOR BIO<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rachel-smith-6bbab01b3\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rachel Smith<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a communication executive who works with the content marketing team at Affable, an influencer marketing company that provides AI-driven solutions that allows you to plan and execute your influencer campaigns strategically.
