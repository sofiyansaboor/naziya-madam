I\u2019ll briefly explain what AI is, what its uses are, and what benefits it gives.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s get started.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>What Is Artificial Intelligence?<\/h3>\r\nTo put it simply, artificial intelligence refers to an intelligence showcased by machines that imitate cognitive functions performed by humans. That\u2019s the technical description, it boils down to the program being able to learn and analyze certain patterns. Let\u2019s simplify it by understanding what it can do. This includes problem-solving, data analysis, language translation, speech recognition, data analysis, and learning. AI has already been widely used in marketing.\r\n\r\nTake an example from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108211218\/https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/\">Amazon<\/a>. They use AI to show only relevant products to individual shoppers based on their previous searches, views, and purchases. This increases the chance of a shopper to make a repeat purchase. Now, this method is used by other eCommerce companies.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s take a look at other ways AI can be used.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>7 Ways You Can Use AI in Your Digital Marketing Plan<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>1. AI-Powered Logo Maker<\/h4>\r\nOne of the unique ways AI is used goes back to the beginning of website making. An\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108211218\/https:\/\/zyro.com\/logo-maker\">AI-powered logo maker<\/a>\u00a0helps new webmasters or business owners who are operating on a tight budget by generating a logo based on their preferences.\r\n\r\nThis work is usually a few different canvases with the basic design, which the user can then customize to their liking, from its shape, fonts, and colors. Once done, they just need to hit the submit button, and the logo is generated automatically. You can even download them in high resolution.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>2. Product Recommendations<\/h4>\r\nMany eCommerce brands use AI to track their customers\u2019 habits, buying behavior, and preferences. This is to help them make suggestions on other products that their customers might be interested in to assist in scaling up sales and revenue growth.\r\n\r\nAI can do data analysis far quicker and more accurately than humans. It collects and analyzes details of past interactions with your business and uses other\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108211218\/https:\/\/www.sisense.com\/analytics-tools\/\">analytics tools<\/a>\u00a0to go through massive amounts of data and give you powerful insights.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>3. Chatbot<\/h4>\r\nAI chatbots have enabled businesses to go from the traditional<b>\u00a0one-to-one<\/b>\u00a0approach to a\u00a0<b>one-to-many<\/b>\u00a0approach, giving multiple customers support at once. This is due to the development of language processing, voice conversion, and semantic recognition technology.\r\n\r\nOne significant advantage of AI chatbots is that they don\u2019t need rest, allowing them to answer customer queries 24\/7. This, in turn, improves customer experience. Additionally, customers can also choose the language to communicate with the AI chatbots, hence delivering localized customer service.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>4. Web Design<\/h4>\r\nThe existence of AI in web design allows anyone to be able to create a great website. It takes all of the necessary coding requirements. It turns it into a website builder where customers can simply choose a template and customize every element using multiple tools.\r\n\r\nNot only customize each element, but AI can also help users generate content for their new site. All they need to do is place a few keywords on the AI content generator, and it will create content based on those words.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>5. Market Analysis<\/h4>\r\nAI covers a massive area of marketing analytics, from automated decision management to social media analytics. AI merges diverse data sources to figure out the patterns and predict future results.\r\n\r\nAI makes the job of marketing analysts much easier. Using analytic tools like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108211218\/https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/analytics\/web\/\">Google Analytics<\/a>, you can create more meaningful outcomes and pump insights in real-time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>6. Email Marketing<\/h4>\r\nLike chatbots, AI in email marketing allows for a\u00a0<b>one-to-many<\/b>\u00a0approach when sending personalized emails by basing it on user behaviors.\r\n\r\nNot only that but AI also helps marketers optimize their email campaigns by using tools like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108211218\/https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">Mailchimp<\/a>. It dynamically analyzes and optimizes campaigns quickly by analyzing your past campaigns and merging it with existing customer behavior to create a fitting plan that is flexible to change.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>7. Marketing Content<\/h4>\r\nYou can now discover which content is most useful to use for marketing, thanks to the AI\u2019s analysis of your target audience\u2019s behavior. Marketers can now understand what type of content works for an audience and how to segment different audiences with different pieces.\r\n\r\nBased on AI statistics,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108211218\/https:\/\/serpwatch.io\/blog\/content-marketing-statistics\/\">40% of millennials trust video content more<\/a>\u00a0than other types. Thus marketers should focus more on video content.\r\n\r\nAI can also curate and create content. Like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108211218\/https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/?gl=IN\">Youtube<\/a>\u2019s recommendation system that gives suggestions for videos based on the user\u2019s previous behavior, it can also be applied to suggest blogs, videos, and other forms of content that can interest a user when visiting your site.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Benefits of AI-Powered Digital Marketing for Your Business<\/h3>\r\nTapping into AI\u2019s potential makes it easier for your business to stay on top with the latest marketing trends and remain competitive. With that said, here are some other benefits of AI-powered digital marketing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Greater Audience Targeting<\/h4>\r\nAI lets you analyze data so you can predict the buying behavior of your target audience. Using data from sources like online transactions and internet cookies is a great place to start. Your AI can help highlight\u00a0<b>Unique Selling Point<\/b>\u00a0that set your business apart from competitors.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Improved Customer Experience<\/h4>\r\nLooking at AI\u2019s uses for digital marketing above, I can say that AI\u2019s purpose intersects with user experience. AI helps tailor your content based on a more profound understanding of customer motivations and behaviors.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Better Content Delivery on Social Media<\/h4>\r\nSince AI can track your target audience\u2019s preferences and behavior, you can use the data and incorporate it into your social media marketing.\r\n\r\nAfter the AI has identified your potential customers, you can know when is the most effective time to post relevant content. By continuously making content pertinent to your audience using that method, you can increase your social media campaigns\u2019 success.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Dynamic Pricing<\/h4>\r\nProviding discounts is a guaranteed way to boost sales, but some customers are willing to buy with smaller or no discounts at all.\r\n\r\nBy using AI, you can set the discount percentage based on demand, availability, customer profiles, and other factors so you can maximize both your sales and profits.\r\n\r\nTake an example of when searching for a flight ticket. One day you go and search for a flight but don\u2019t decide to buy it that day. Then you come back a couple of days later to find that the price has gone up.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\r\nYou know now the uses of AI along with some of its benefits. All that\u2019s left to do now is to apply the help of AI to your digital marketing strategies and watch as you get the benefits from it. Remember that an AI is only as good as the data you feed it, so make sure to provide it with an in-depth and massive amount of data, and they\u2019ll do the work for you.\r\n\r\nGood luck![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]You might have read or heard that AI plays a vital role in digital marketing, and now you\u2019re wondering what AI is and how exactly it benefits your marketing strategies?
