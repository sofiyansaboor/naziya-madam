Briefly share about yourself, your hobbies, likes or dislikes, etc.<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<b>Deepak:-<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hello Digiperform! First of all thanks a lot for giving me this opportunity.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, I\u2019ve always loved computers &amp; internet and wanted to become a programmer by pursuing a degree in Computer Science. But, somehow, I got into Mechanical Engineering. (Well, that&#8217;s another long story)<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in 2014, during my 1st year of engineering, I discovered the term \u201c<strong>B<em>logging<\/em><\/strong>\u201d and started collecting information about it. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, now, after 5+ years, I\u2019m completely into online marketing &#8211; blogging and some other kinds of digital marketing.<\/span>\r\nYes, you can clearly state me as an example who didn&#8217;t follow his career as per his degree.\r\nLike, your campaign <em><strong>Skill Over Degree<\/strong><\/em>!\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, I\u2019m a workaholic person and love working on my websites. Most of the time you will find me with my laptop only. But, I do go out with my friends on weekends. Having fun is also very important.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my early days, I had started many blogs, viral news sites and I was a part of the founding team of a rooms-for-rent searching startup called <strong>Hitbik<\/strong>, but nothing seemed to be working.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later on, I got into affiliate marketing and earned my first few pennies promoting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clickbank.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clickbank<\/a> products. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, that\u2019s how I got into digital marketing and made my passion, my profession!<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform:- Please tell us about DigiTechnolog. How it got started?<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Deepak:-<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digitechnolog.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digiTechnolog<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a digital marketing blog where I share my understanding and findings related to various parameters like SEO, affiliate marketing, productivity hacks, and some other technical things.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like I mentioned earlier, before starting digiTechnolog, I had started my very first affiliate website promoting a Clickbank product. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, with almost zero knowledge of SEO, I was able to rank that website on the first page of Google. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The site made me my very first <strong>$500<\/strong> and, unfortunately, after 2 months, due to poor search engine optimization, the website got penalized.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, I decided to start a blog where I can share the real working ways of digital marketing, especially SEO, from my experience and help other people who are just getting started in the field as well.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, whatever I have learned in digital marketing, share on my blog digiTechnolog regularly.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform:-\u00a0 As you have shared Why you decided to start blogging, we would like to know the \u201cBest Moment\u201d in your blogging journey.<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Deepak:-<\/b>\u00a0To be honest, I have always been passionate about blogging.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to follow a famous <strong>Indian blogger Amit Agarwal<\/strong> and loved the way he used to share some really interesting and informative articles on his blog <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.labnol.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Labnol.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, blogging was just my passion back then, but now, it has become my profession. After 3 back-to-back unsuccessful blogs, I started digiTechnolog which is still in the initial phase, but it\u2019s growing fast.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best moment in my blogging journey was when I earned my first $$$ online. It was a kind of motivation for me.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Digiperform:-\u00a0 As a blogger, how do you see digital marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Deepak:- <\/strong><\/span><i>Digital marketing evolves every day.<\/i><\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we know, almost 50% of the world is not connected to the internet yet, so in the near future, digital marketing will keep maximizing its reach to the newly connected ones.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big companies will focus on deep analytics and increased data mining (such as AI and Machine Learning) in order to serve relevant and personalized content to the users. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those days are almost gone when marketers used to send irrelevant emails in bulk and expect sales from that.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b><i>Mobile-focused contents will rise.<\/i><\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interactive and engaging content will be preferred over the normal blog posts. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video and audio content will attract more visitors and, in the few coming years, video contents will attract almost 80% of all web traffic. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the online companies have already started to shift towards video and podcasts kinds of digital marketing.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to me, the top 3 trends that will prevail in the coming years are:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b>Content Personalization<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one likes to go through the contents which are of no use or completely irrelevant to them. After a significant increase in data mining and deep analytics by online companies, consumers will get to see more personalized and highly relevant contents only.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers will even be able to customize the contents of their choice.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b>Voice Search<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must have seen the increasing trend of voice searches. According to a prediction, by the year 2020, 50% of all the searches will be conducted via voice search.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, creating voice search friendly contents should be on the priority list of digital marketers.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b>Influencer Marketing<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumers will trust other consumers more than brand advertisements and digital marketing campaigns will turn more like content-driven marketing campaigns.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/free-influencer-marketing-course-the-beginners-guide-to-influencer-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">influencer marketing<\/a> is nothing but the improved version of celebrity endorsement which will keep rising significantly in the coming years.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform:- \u00a0Some people feel blogging can be a very boring career. How you would like to answer that? Is it boring or people are lazy to think like that?<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Deepak:-<\/b>\u00a0<em>Blogging is boring; only if you are not passionate about it.<\/em><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes 1-2 years before a blog may start making some money. You will need to have a lot of patience. In my opinion, people should start blogging in the niche they already know well about, because that would need lesser research while writing articles and it won\u2019t feel boring either.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, I mainly write about topics which I know well about. And, I really enjoy writing blog posts related to SEO, productivity hacks, etc.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digitechnolog.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-22805 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-08-at-3.49.13-PM.png\" alt=\"digiTechnolog\" width=\"306\" height=\"408\" \/><\/a>I always recommend beginners to start blogging part-time while pursuing a degree or doing a job, because in the first few years it would hardly get you any money. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, later, when you want to do it for full time, put all your efforts to grow that site.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform:- \u00a0What are do\u2019s and don\u2019ts one should follow if someone is looking for Blogging as a career?<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Deepak:-<\/b>\u00a0According to me, the following are the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts that everyone should follow while starting up with blogging.<\/span>\r\n<b>Do\u2019s<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, start your blog side-by-side with your college or job.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create your blog with WordPress because it is easier to use and good for the SEO purpose.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blog something you already know about.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write detailed articles and do proper research while writing.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always try to use 5-10 images in your article.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Link to external related sources which will make your content more credible.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<b>Don\u2019ts<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t go for free domains or free hosting.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t keep your site\u2019s design clustered.

Share which you admire the most?<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Deepak:-<\/b>\u00a0Indeed!<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I follow a lot of influencers and digital marketers to keep myself updated with the latest information related to the digital marketing space.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a huge fan of Brian Dean\u2019s blog <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">backlinko.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where he shares really high-quality articles and guides on various digital marketing related topics. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, I think every blogger and digital marketer should take inspiration from Brian Dean for the kind of quality contents that he creates.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brian\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/hub\/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO Hub<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an amazing place to master SEO skills for beginners as well as experts.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform:-\u00a0 You are experienced in blogging? Please share your experience of how a fresher can start his\/her blogging career? And, what are the various ways to earn from blogging?<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Deepak:-<\/b>\u00a0Blogging may seem like rocket science at first, but once you get into, it becomes easier.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, my advice to the freshers is that go ahead, set up a website and start writing. Don\u2019t wait for the perfect time and don\u2019t expect your first few articles to be perfect &#8211; let it as it is.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just write as you speak &#8211; in a conversational style, because blogging is all about the content you provide and remember <\/span><b>\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/content-called-king-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Content is the King<\/a>\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Just make sure that your content is informative and provides a lot of value to the readers.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, when it comes to earning money from blogging, below are the 3 best methods for beginners.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By affiliate promotion<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Adsense or other ads network<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By selling your own products<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the people who are just starting up, I recommend going with affiliate promotion over other methods of monetization.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can join various affiliate networks like <a href=\"https:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Amazon Affiliate Program<\/strong><\/a> etc. depending upon your niche and topic of the contents of your blog. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can recommend related products which are relevant for your readers in between the blog posts. The main reason why I like earning by promoting affiliate products is that you don\u2019t need to put a lot of effort into creating your own products. You just earn promoting famous and established products through your blog.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few affiliate networks even offer commissions of up to <strong>50%<\/strong>. So, if there is a lot of valuable traffic on your blog then you can earn a great amount of money.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/adsense\/start\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Adsense program<\/a> or some other ads network can also make you money but not as much as the affiliate promotion.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting some experience, you can also create some paid and premium content like online courses, eBooks etc. for your readers. If your content is of high quality and provides a lot of value to the customers then just sit back and watch your blog making money.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform:- \u00a0Any suggestion you would like to give to our readers and students who want to make a career as a blogger?<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Deepak:- <\/strong><\/span><i>Blogging tests your patience and determination.<\/i><\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blogging is definitely not for the people who are looking to earn money online quickly. It may not make you money at first but blogging does teach you the way of life. Like earlier, successful people used to write diaries &#8211; blogging is nothing but an online diary.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing regularly can help you in<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving your writing skills,<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving your present ability,\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Improving your storytelling skills<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read other people\u2019s blogs, stay updated, take inspiration from them and produce contents that your readers will love to read to.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, with that being said, the interview has come to an end, and hope I was able to put my thoughts impactfully.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can catch me on social media:<\/span>\r\n<b>Twitter:<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theDeepakNess\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/theDeepakNess<\/span><\/a>\r\n<b>Facebook:<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeepakNess\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeepakNess<\/span><\/a>\r\n<b>Email:<\/b> <a href=\"mailto:deepak@digitechnolog.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deepak@digitechnolog.com<\/span><\/a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<strong>Digiperform:<\/strong>\r\nWow!
