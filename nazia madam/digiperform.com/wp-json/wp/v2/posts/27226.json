There are developers and designers working together to make sure they reach final results according to the needs and ideas of their clients. However, there can be a lot of confusion and some misunderstandings, unless there&#8217;s a killer web design brief.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A web design brief is created with the aim to communicate the needs of the client. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arkasoftwares.com\/web-development\">custom web development company<\/a> ensures that everyone&#8217;s on the same page. It needs to be detailed, goal-oriented, and communicate the right message to everyone involved. This is why we&#8217;ve put together a guide with 6 essential steps for writing a winning web design brief.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s break it down together.<\/span>\r\n<h1><b>Your Business Overview<\/b><b>\r\n<\/b><\/h1>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your web developers need to be familiar with the type of business you&#8217;re running, to better understand your needs.

Therefore, describe your target audience in terms of:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">age<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sex<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">location<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online behavior<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">habits<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preferences<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give a detailed report about your customers and make sure you provide all the information you\u2019ve got on them.<\/span>\r\n<h1><b>The Goals of the Project<\/b><\/h1>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now it\u2019s time to set the goals that you\u2019d like the developing team to achieve with the project. That means you should explain what you want your new website to bring you.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There can be all types of goals, especially depending on whether you\u2019re creating a brand new website or fixing the old one. Here\u2019s what we have in mind:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve website performance<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">add an e-commerce section<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create a new website to help potential customers find you and get informed<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">generate more leads<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve traffic<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve your online presence\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you know what <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2020\/02\/20\/13-website-design-principles-any-business-should-keep-in-mind\/?sh=405bb056dc8a\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web design principles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you want to follow, and state them clearly in your web design brief to make sure there\u2019s no room for confusion or misunderstandings.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h1><b>Specific Features &amp; Requirements<\/b><\/h1>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve set the ground with some basic information, it\u2019s time to dig a little deeper and get into more details in your web design brief.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any specific technical requirements you\u2019d like your new website to have, make sure to write it down.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what you may want to cover:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user logins, registration, and authorization<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">products and services you\u2019re selling and offering<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">product categories<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payment &amp; checkout methods<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">site blog\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About us page<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.editingcorp.com\/optimize-your-workflow-with-portfolio-website\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">portfolio<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> page<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user profiles<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can even describe each section, and make a list of features you want to see on the screen.
