Shariq"},"content":{"rendered":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more young people than ever before setting up in business on their own, many are turning to the internet to share their experiences and grow.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Priyanka Saini was 18 years old when she started working. She took small steps to reach a level where she could work on her business idea. She provided Digital Marketing services to many hospitality brands.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, she was joined by Mohd. Shariq and together they created \u201cWeirdos\u201d initially a Digital Marketing provider and eventually turned into a clothing brand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weirdo.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weirdo.in<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their social media pages are quite different, often filled with quotes and poetry, to which Priyanka says \u201cthrough them, the audience feels connected to the brand name in a way\u201d.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While launching the clothing line, they aimed to sell 10 t-shirts in a month, they ended up selling much more!<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch this young entrepreneurial duo talk about their inspiring journey, social media promotions and running two different ideas simultaneously and earning profits in both!<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita-My first question to you is that you\u2019re just 22 years old \u2013 Please walk me through your background. How did you come up with the idea and what\u2019s your Education qualification?\u00a0<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0it\u2019s not even 22, when I started I was just 18. Right after my 12th, I was unsure about what career path I should choose and ended up for Bachelors&#8217;s in computer science. Simultaneously I kept myself engaged in different activities and started working and took up a few internships. Those internships turned into potential clients. The internships were in Content writing and Social Media Marketing.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Nikita- What were your expectations when you started?<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0The expectation or motivation initially was not to get too big. But to get independent, so I could do things on my own. I wanted to pay for my classes that I was taking like gymnastics. So I wanted those expenses to be covered by taking up internships.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Nikita- Welcome Shariq, my question to you is, how did you two meet and how did you collaborate?<\/b>\r\n<b>Shariq:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I was inspired by Priyanka\u2019s work in college. She was doing multiple internships and getting fit, I was at that time!\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita: So, were you both classmates?\u00a0<\/b>\r\n<b>Shariq<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: yeah.<\/span>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0So in the first year, we sort of merged.<\/span>\r\n<b>Shariq:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I was more into the technical stuff. I thought I was doing good and I will find a job after B.Tech. But then I saw her, taking care of her expenses and I was living off my father\u2019s money.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita: So that\u2019s when you came up with the idea of Weirdos. Tell me about the name.<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I was called a weirdo.<\/span>\r\n<b>Shariq:\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She used to dress very differently and was not personality conscious at all.<\/span>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0So, I was looking for Domain names and did not get any. This sort of came in my mind, I searched for it, it was available and we took it.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita: As I know, it\u2019s a clothing brand but tell me more about the products and services.<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0The clothing brand is something that came later. How it started- we were offering Digital marketing Services, more in the hospitality industry. Some of them are- Alpina Hotels, Social Street Cafe, Nagpal Jewellers, Detailing Skull, The Vintage Hotels and many more.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So besides that, we were building an audience that could connect to the brand more, because this is something that is service-based and people don\u2019t actually like reading about. So we had our Instagram page for Weirdos wherein we started publishing poetry and quotes page on Instagram.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita: So initially the idea was that you provide Digital Marketing Services to Clients and later on you came up with the clothing brand. So How is that doing?\u00a0\u00a0<\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Priyanka: <\/b>We have like 8k followers on Instagram and we wanted to check if the people that are connected to us would buy something from us or not. That was the time we knew we can launch something for our people. So we came up with the t-shirts range that is quirky and are trying to convert all niches, interest areas to design for.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the whole idea and its launch and the progress indeed was a hypothesis. We needed to have set a goal and outperform that to keep the flow going.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial target was to sell 10 t-shirts within 30 days without any investment in ads or human resources with solely the audience we already had. And 15-20 went into the development of the website post that we could let people know that we have come up with a product range.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it was just 10 days now post the launch and we did make 13 sales.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now now we knew we are in the right direction and all we need to do is explore new ways to evolve.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Nikita- How is Instagram helping you out in terms of Digital Marketing Services and selling out the clothing?<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka:\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two segments that we work on. It\u2019s not that everything is online. Firstly it was a Digital Marketing website now it\u2019s pure e-commerce. The first goal of the 10 sales was purely organic. Out idea was more about touching the strings of the hearts of people so that when they are connected, we can sell the product.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Nikita: Talk about Pinterest?<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I love the platform a lot of people are connected to the platform too, the sole idea behind Pinterest too is the same as Instagram but an add on is that it helps us drive organic traffic on the website, which Instagram doesn&#8217;t allow us for now.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Nikita\u00a0Talk about blogs, how do they help?<\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b>Priyanka<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Weirdo is solely around touching the string to people&#8217;s heart and it will always be so the blog section also has poetry and will talk more about styling tips, start-up tips, and a few marketing tips down the line.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because we do not want to lose the essence of anything that we are into. We wish to project a real-time picture of what we are to the people connected with us.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita: Plans? What do you target in the future?<\/b>\r\n<b>Shariq:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Growing our collection for every need, from kids section to wedding collection. From jeans to lehnga to suits and maternity dresses. Like I told you we want the customer to feel at ease while we do the rest for them.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita: What is your message for all the young aspirants who want to start something on their own?<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Digital Marketing courses are good, but besides that I want people to be connected with some internships or real-time work as well. Like I started pretty early and did multiple internships and that\u2019s how I learned.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Shariq:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Even today, we face many challenges like website going down, we research and fix it on our own. Continuous learning is important.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Nikita: A message for all the women out there, who aspire to achieve something big in life?<\/b>\r\n<b>Priyanka:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0You&#8217;ve got it in you and just go for it. Because there were times when I doubted myself if this is the right path. My passion was to develop something that would connect to people as much as possible. So if you have a passion just go for it. It\u2019s not always about the money, it\u2019s about happiness and we are pretty happy.\u00a0<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"With more young people than ever before setting up in business on their own, many are turning to the internet to share their experiences and grow.
