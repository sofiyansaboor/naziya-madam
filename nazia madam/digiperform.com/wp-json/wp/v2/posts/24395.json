Boosts Web Page Traffic<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a reason why digital marketing specialists put so much effort into proper search engine optimization\u2014Web page traffic. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">To increase traffic to your site, you need to rank high on search engine results. The top spots on the SERP or search engine results page typically generate the highest number of clicks and visits. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If a potential customer searches for a product or service online, and your brand does not appear on the first page of SERP, chances are you\u2019ll lose the sale to a company that appeared on the top 5 search engine results. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if your product is better than your rival, it would not matter if clients don\u2019t know you exist. SEO is a component of online marketing that helps your Web page gain relevant traffic, more visitors, and better conversions.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>2.
