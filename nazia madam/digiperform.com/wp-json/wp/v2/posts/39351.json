You can either remove the post manually or choose the profanity filter. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The profanity filter automatically pulls the content consisting of provided keywords.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another amazing benefit of using social media aggregators is that they provide real updates.
