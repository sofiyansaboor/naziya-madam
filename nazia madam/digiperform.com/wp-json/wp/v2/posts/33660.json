So it\u2019s important to stay in Google\u2019s good graces to keep your site on page one.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few ways in which you can do it. The first one is by building a website that is tailored to the intent of your keyword\/keyphrase. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way is to create content that will always be relevant for your target audience and manage to rank better than other websites in your niche.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last one, and the most important, is by optimizing your website for mobile searches which will improve the organic traffic as well as the ranking on mobile devices.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of ranking higher in search engine results cannot be undermined as it helps you gain new customers, generate leads, and have more visibility among other companies in your industry. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can also help you fight against competitors who have advantages over you due to their strong SEO activities.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at how you can rank your business website higher in search in more depth.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Enhance the user experience on your website<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The user experience is the most important aspect of any website. A well-designed, easy-to-use, and informative website can lead to a high ranking in search for your business. Some ways you can improve your website&#8217;s user experience include:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create easy navigation for visitors to easily navigate the website<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design your website with mobile-friendly features<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a good first impression through videos and images on your homepage<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Displaying user-friendly information on your homepage like contact details, announcements about new products or services, and social media profiles.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure no user has to click more than 3 times to get to where they need to be on your site.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4>Create keyword-rich titles and meta descriptions<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword-rich titles and meta descriptions are becoming increasingly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ninepeaksmedia.com\/b2b-seo-implementing-seo-for-b2b-companies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">important for B2B SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A keyword-rich title with a meta description can help you rank your website for targeted searches that have a significant number of monthly searches.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good way to create a keyword-rich title is to also include the main benefit or action that your product provides. Some examples of this are &#8220;The 6 Best Ways To Find Your Next Job&#8221; or &#8220;How To Bake The Perfect Cookie In 5 Easy Steps&#8221;<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meta descriptions should describe what the product is, the benefits it provides, and how it solves problems.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating these on your website can help increase conversion rates and increase SEO rankings through high-quality content on your website.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Create excellent SEO-optimized content<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To write great content, you need to know SEO best practices. You&#8217;ll need to understand how search engines work and what they&#8217;re looking for in your content so that you can make sure that it&#8217;s optimized for SEO.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing about writing great content is that it needs to be readable by humans. It is also important to think about the keywords that your readers would use when searching for a product or service like yours.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order not to overwhelm the reader with information, it is good practice to break up long passages of text into smaller sections as well as paragraphs and subparagraphs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some best practices for SEO optimized content include:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use H1, H2, H3 headers in your articles<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use images to break up your text, Every 400-500 words is usually a good rule to follow<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a hero image at the top of your articles to grab the reader\u2019s attention<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No keyword stuffing. Google doesn\u2019t like this so make sure you or your writers keep keyword density below 3%<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interlink between articles to help Google understand your website better. Tools like Link Whisper are excellent for this once you reach 100 articles or more<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimize images for speed<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add the main keyword of the article early into the first paragraph<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Get more backlinks<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backlinks are the cornerstone of a website&#8217;s SEO. They can help propel your website to the top of search engine rankings and make you more visible in search engine results.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Link building is a difficult task with many obstacles. Here are some tips on how to get more backlinks for your website:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>1. Create high-quality content<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is unique and interesting enough for a reader to want to share it on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>2. Find content<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that has already been written about by other sources but does not have an &#8220;About&#8221; section on its page where links can be found.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>3. Guest blogging<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the most effective methods for earning backlinks and it has been done by many famous brands. You need to be careful when guest blogging because bloggers can sometimes take advantage of you if you don&#8217;t do your research or follow best practices.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>4. Attracting \u201cLink Bait\u201d articles with unique content and infographics<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can pay someone on Fiverr to create excellent and unique infographics based on some original research you carried out. In time &#8211; if done correctly &#8211; these articles and infographics will be linked to by other sites.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>5. Content promotion<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have written valuable content on a particular topic, promote it on social media and other digital platforms by highlighting the topics covered in the article. Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok allow you to laser target your audience very specifically.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone then links to this article on their website it adds to your backlink profile, and the more backlinks the better.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Improve your page speed<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Page speed is an important ranking factor for Google Search. It can have a substantial impact on your website\u2019s search rank. You can improve page speed by optimizing images, JavaScript, and CSS file sizes and using browser caching to reduce network requests.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also consider using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to improve your page speed and reduce bandwidth costs. Once your site can justify the cost you can also implement tools like WP Rocket.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WP Rocket is a WordPress plugin that helps you manage your website faster and get more traffic.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Add your business to Google Maps<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get your business listed on Google Maps, you should submit your business&#8217; address and contact information to Google. In addition, you should also include a link to your website. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">f you add the address of your business, it will show up in the search results when someone searches for something related to what your company does.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example: when someone searches for \u201cchocolate shop near me\u201d, their results may include stores like Ghirardelli and Godiva because they have their addresses on Google Maps.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Match Your Content to Search Intent<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search intent is a term used to refer to the type of keyword searches a Google user performs. To rank higher in the search engine, your content should match your search intent. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most businesses focus on using keywords that match their website\u2019s main topic, they should also use keywords that are related but not too closely.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes it easier for your content to rank in search engines and increase traffic on your website.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Reduce Your Bounce Rate<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bounce rate is a metric that measures how many visitors leave your website without interacting with any of the content. It is also an important metric to understand how people find your business website and how they are responding to it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to optimize your site\u2019s search ranking, you need to know the factors that lead to a higher bounce rate.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three main causes of a higher bounce rate &#8211; the content on your website, poor usability, and poor user experience.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you want visitors to navigate through your site easily and get what they need quickly, they should have an interactive layout with clear calls-to-action and well-written content.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Mobile Friendliness<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With smartphone and smart device usage increasing, businesses need to be mobile-friendly. This includes the website design and the content on it.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips for designing your website and content to be mobile-friendly:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use responsive or adaptive web design (AWD) in your website so that it will resize with different screen resolutions and devices.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you use text sizing according to the font size of your text so that no matter what the font size is there is an optimal reading experience on all devices.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a light, mobile-friendly theme such as Generate Press or Astra<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your plugins to a minimum<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimize images with tools like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/shortpixel.com\/\"><b>Short Pixel<\/b><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Use schema markup and structured data on your website<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schema markup is a way of adding structured data to your website which helps in getting your website higher in search rankings.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schema markup is an XML file that is added to the head section of the document. It tells search engines what content on your site should be taken into consideration for ranking purposes. Schema markup can be added by using a plugin or by editing the source code manually.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many benefits to using schema markup on your website. It helps you get ranked higher and generates more traffic from Google and other search engines as well.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Use tools like Ahrefs<\/h4>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\"><b>Ahrefs software<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> assists businesses by helping them to understand their competitors\u2019 SEO strategies and tactics. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mikekhorev.com\/top-5-ahrefs-alternatives\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some Ahrefs alternatives<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allow users to see the website analytics of their competitors and monitor changes in the search engine rankings over time.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of ranking your business website higher in search are numerous. Not only can you see more traffic from organic search, but you\u2019ll be more likely able to use Display Ads as another source of your site\u2019s income.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re looking to improve the placement of your website in search, then the tips above will give you a strong foundation to build on.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]Every company wants to rank higher in search engine results, it means more visibility and more revenue to your business.
