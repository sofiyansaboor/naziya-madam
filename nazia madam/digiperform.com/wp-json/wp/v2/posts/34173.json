If so, you need link management to help you organize your campaigns properly.\r\n\r\nAs a serious affiliate marketer, you might become an affiliate for dozens of brands over time. You might gather links to 100s of products in just a few short months.\r\n\r\nWithout proper link management, keeping track of your links will quickly become overwhelming. Utilizing a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/geniuslink.com\/link-management\">link management platform<\/a> will allow you to find and set up each link one time and then use it in multiple pieces of content without having to go back and find it again.\r\n\r\nOr, what happens when you need to remove links to a particular brand, or your codes change for some reason. Without a link management tool, you would have to go find and edit each link manually. That might not be a big deal in the beginning, but if you\u2019re serious about affiliate marketing, it\u2019s going to be a major ordeal down the road.\r\n\r\nAnd, the benefits of link management for serious affiliate marketers don\u2019t end there. Let\u2019s dive into all of this in more detail!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>What is link management?<\/h3>\r\nUtilizing link management means that you have a system in place for organizing, editing, and analyzing all of the links you create and share, no matter how big your affiliate marketing campaigns get.\r\n\r\nLinks are the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/affiliate-marketing-in-2020\/\">core of affiliate marketing<\/a>. Between your blog, social media, email list, YouTube channel, and more, you probably couldn\u2019t even begin to estimate how many links you create and share in just one month.\r\n\r\nWith a central link management system, you can create links once, edit them, and track them, all from one convenient location.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>The Benefits of Link Management for Affiliates<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>1. Automate Basic Link Management Tasks<\/h4>\r\nLet\u2019s dive into this a little more. As a serious affiliate marketer, you might be representing dozens of brands with hundreds of products. Not only that, but you might be signed up with several different affiliate marketing programs, too.\r\n\r\nTrying to organize all of this without a good system in place is going to cost you a lot of time you could be devoting to more important things\u2026 like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.outbrain.com\/blog\/how-to-write-content-that-converts\/\">creating amazing content<\/a>\u00a0and marketing your business.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned that a centralized link management tool allows you to create, edit, and track all of your links in one place.\r\n\r\nBut, even more than that, once you\u2019ve added your affiliate information to the tool, it will automatically monetize your links. A good link management tool will even notify you when a product is out of stock or a link is broken and needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nNot only that but links can be imported and exported between all of your websites. No more setting up dozens of links for new blogs! Talk about a time saver!\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h4>2. Create Custom Short Links<\/h4>\r\nUsing custom links created with your domain name is important. Custom short links boost brand recognition, improve trust, and increase click-through rates. With a link management tool, you can create links with a variety of different extensions. You can even create custom domains for links related to specific affiliate marketing campaigns.\r\n\r\nNot only that but when you create custom short links, you have full ownership of them. When your links are created using a third-party domain, they belong to whoever owns that domain. You can\u2019t edit or manage them. So, if that domain gets blacklisted as spam, your emails will end up in spam folders instead of being seen by your subscribers.\r\n\r\nYou will also have full control over your link data, which will be stored securely within the tool. That\u2019s usually not the case with traditional URL shorteners.\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h4>3. Improved Collaboration and Categorization<\/h4>\r\nHaving all of your links are categorized and accessible from one centralized location is extremely beneficial for collaboration among team members. The links can be categorized by workspace, location, domain name, or whatever else makes sense for your team.\r\n\r\nEven if your team is small (or it\u2019s just you), organizing in this way can be incredibly useful. Each team member can be granted specific permissions and see each other\u2019s links and share them from the same place. This prevents members from creating several different links that go back to the same product or blog post.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, it keeps your links organized so that you can assess the success of your campaigns more easily. Links can be tagged with color codes to indicate which campaign they belong to or what type of product or service they are.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>4. Send Traffic To Multiple Destinations<\/h4>\r\nA good link management tool will allow you to send traffic to multiple destinations from the same link. This feature makes it incredibly easy to do\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/vwo.com\/ab-testing\/\">A\/B Split Testing<\/a>\u00a0by specifying which proportion of users you want to have sent to each landing page.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to determine which landing pages are performing and converting best with your audience. This valuable insight allows you to adjust your campaigns accordingly to maximize click-through rates and conversions.\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h3>Final Thoughts<\/h3>\r\nWhen it comes to affiliate marketing tools, you can\u2019t beat a good link management system. Having all of your links in a centralized dashboard where you can insert and edit them quickly and easily across multiple platforms streamlines the entire process. Add in the ability to categorize your links and send traffic to multiple destinations from the same link and you\u2019ll take your affiliate marketing campaigns to a whole new level.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]Are you serious about creating an income with affiliate marketing?
