Social media platforms have provided us with the luxury of staying connected with each other so billions of people are using the network to get in touch with their friends, loved ones, and colleagues. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the topmost used social media apps are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram is known to attract numerous users all around the world. This picture-sharing app is no longer solely for the purpose of personal use. Most businesses are now branding themselves using Instagram as it helps them to connect with their marketplaces and potential customers.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how could you productively use Instagram to attract prospective customers to your business? The use of hashtags is very effective when it comes to branding your business. These tags work like keywords when used in Instagram posts, media presentations, and videos.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h4>What are hashtags?<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashtags are a single word or small phrase followed by a pound sign (#). They convert a simple word or term into a searchable keyword, let\u2019s say if your business is about legos, you can create relevant tags by using a pound sign with it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your hashtag would be something like #legos. Hashtags are clickable and lead you to similar accounts or posts that use the same word or phrase.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h4>Some basics for\u00a0 hashtags<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They must start with the # sign without any punctuations or spaces.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram Account should be public for it so whenever someone clicks on the hashtags you have created they would be able to land on your Instagram page.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashtags should be short-length and precise.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that the word\/phrase you are using in these tags is relevant to the post.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spamming hashtags does not ensure better results. Therefore, you should not flood each post with hashtags.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h4>Why are hashtags Important?<\/h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5>1. Brand Awareness<\/h5>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of hashtags greatly helps in <a href=\"https:\/\/sleekflow.io\/blog\/whatsapp-instagram-marketing-singapore\">brand awareness<\/a>. For example, when Nike launched the \u201cJust Do IT\u201d slogan, people shared designs of products with their loved ones and friends after buying them from the company. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, this word-of-mouth marketing from the customers directly gave a boost to the company&#8217;s online business and the sales kept rolling in a massive number every single day.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the use of hashtags can make prospective customers know about your catchphrase, brand, new products, and services. Using the same promotional hashtags can lead to a high volume of traffic to your product landing page. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that your hashtags are searchable as well. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you are using multiple hashtags for different products, you must use a couple of specific hashtags in all of your posts. For instance, Nike would always include the hashtag #nike in the posts to keep spreading awareness about its brand. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It creates a powerful impact on brand recognition and growth itself.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h5>2. Targeting the desired audience<\/h5>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashtags are a great asset to promote your business to a particular audience or followers. Almost all business accounts rely heavily on optimizing their posts with hashtags these days because they help in boosting the search volume to their posts organically.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0The usage of hashtags attracts even those users who do not currently follow your account. They might find your page, post or video through a search tool and come to know about the products that you are selling. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can increase your follower count which eventually and leads to better sales for sure. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more followers you have the higher your chances of growing your business. You can also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/followerscart.com\/ca\/buy-instagram-followers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buy Instagram followers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as some websites are providing that service if you are current<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ly a startup<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0business or have less follower count.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h5>3. Connect with followers<\/h5>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that people love the most is to feel important and connected. The use of hashtags makes your customers and your followers feel connected. Any customers would write \u201cNike\u201d in the search bar first if they intend to look for new promotions and the hashtag would help them directly to the new promotions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There might be many great hashtags that people are searching for daily. You must conduct research on the most relevant keywords that the customers are using to find products related to your niches. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using more keywords or hashtags that present your content would help you amplify the sales drastically through the social network.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h5>4: Smart Marketing<\/h5>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although using hashtags is somewhat important in the promotion of content, visual media, images, and posts that you intend to share on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.premierweb.net.au\/tips-for-mastering-instagram\/\">Instagram account<\/a> yet you must refrain from overdoing it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Too many irrelevant tags might kill your posts, making them appear like nothing but a promotional advertisement to the customers.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use smart marketing methods to convince your customers to purchase the items. Meaning that you need to first focus on designing a good ad of the product or services using creative story, script and graphics. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your ad is ready, you need to come with good captions, a contextual description, and a pitch line. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add a call to action button at the end of the video. Use the main hashtags of your brand along with new ones that you believe would present your new products and services in a satisfying manner.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, I would suggest you be more productive and creative when it comes to creating content for your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/followerscart.com\/ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram business profiles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to opt for third-party marketing services and invest a\u00a0 large sum of money on running ads for your company if you succeed in getting enough exposure for free on major social networks like Facebook and Instagram. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to optimizing your posts on these networks is hidden in using hashtags correctly, modestly, and wisely.\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]As a business, it\u2019s an utmost priority to engage as much of the audience as possible.
