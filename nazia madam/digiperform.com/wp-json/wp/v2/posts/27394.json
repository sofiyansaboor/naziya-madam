By harnessing various forms of technologies, businesses today are starting to engage and develop their own smart packaging measures as well as enhance consumer experience and engagement.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses are starting to recognize the importance of connected packaging in today\u2019s world. In fact, its global market share is projected to reach <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/the-global-smart-packaging-market-is-expected-to-grow-from-usd-40-018-58-million-in-2019-to-usd-58-791-56-million-by-the-end-of-2025-at-a-compound-annual-growth-rate-cagr-of-6-62-1029086921\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$59 million in 2025<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, based on industry estimates.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How exactly does connected packaging change the way business processes are done? Let\u2019s count the ways.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>How can businesses use connected packaging?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interactive packaging is streamlining business processes and provides manufacturers with additional channels to exchange information with its consumers. These are the most common ways in which businesses today are using connected packaging:\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Real-time tracking of goods. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With interactive packaging, it\u2019s now possible to trace a product\u2019s location in real-time. In some systems, commodity tracking can start in the production, instead of the traditional distribution process. Businesses can use<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appetitecreative.com\/services\/connected-packaging\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">connected packaging services<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to track an item, no matter at which stage the product is within the supply chain.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>More efficient inventory management:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Businesses can now get rid of paper filing and delayed information access and exchange by using tools like smartphones, tablets, scanners, and other similar technology. By setting up a smart warehouse, supply chain and inventory management are automated, making the processes more efficient and less prone to human errors. In a smart warehouse, everything is interconnected, from the special scanners that read the codes on the product packaging, to the machines that assist humans in making everything work flawlessly. This allows for faster processing of goods from the time they were received, tagged, sorted, organized, and prepared for shipment. This also allows for easier tracking of inventory, where items that need to be replenished are identified at the earliest possible time.<\/span>\r\n<b>Issuing proof of authenticity.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> By adding unique codes on a product\u2019s packaging, some designer brands can now assure their clients of purchasing only authentic products. The end-user can use the code to validate product authenticity and, in some cases, the manufacturer\u2019s location, on the brand\u2019s website, or from a downloadable app.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Maintaining product integrity. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individual codes from the product likewise indicate that the item was not subjected to tampering, theft, unauthorized access, distribution, or use, among other anomalous transactions. Aside from end-users, stores and authorized distributors can check that the product is not counterfeit, protecting the brand\u2019s reputation.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Enhancing customer engagement. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With connected packaging, customers can also access custom-made product-related content such as video tutorials, how-to blogs, and other types of useful content. This means businesses can communicate with their buyers in a more personal manner by providing information that\u2019s meant to instruct, entertain, or address consumers\u2019 pain points. This enhances the brand\u2019s digital presence and allows it to reach a higher number of potential consumers. Some gaming companies use interactive packaging to level up the user experience by transforming traditional cards into digital games. By integrating technology in the cards themselves, companies can offer buyers to unlock new characters, upgrade their character\u2019s superpowers, and access to more game boards.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Promoting customer retention. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connected packaging can promote customer loyalty by integrating product collection offers in digital product inserts. To activate, a buyer runs the code through the site or an app that they need to download. Once the buyer purchases an item, businesses can offer another type of product that may interest the buyer.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Improving customer service.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Businesses can also use interactive packaging to make online (re) ordering and requests for repair and replacement easier for clients. Manufacturers can also make the product easier to use by offering online tutorials or show them the sites available for packaging disposal. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Attracting new clients. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With connected packaging, companies can now share digital content to customers, including free offers or giveaways that can be claimed when the buyer refers a friend to purchase a certain product. Interactive packaging makes it possible for buyers to upload their experiences with a certain product online, or tag their friends to increase brand awareness or as a form of \u2018word of mouth.\u2019<\/span>\r\n<b>Offering digital promotions.\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/top-8-influencer-marketing-trends-for-2021\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how digital marketing works<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in engaging potential users, manufacturers can use connected packaging to offer rewards to customers upon purchase of one product and (potentially) other products included in the whole product line.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Providing exclusive content.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Manufacturers can use connected packaging to relay exclusive content to their buyers that are not available for public consumption. This enhances customer experience and rewards the buyers with better content, making them come back for more.\u00a0 A known beauty brand included makeup tutorials exclusively for their customers in product inserts, increasing the time users spend on their website from an average of 30 seconds to seven minutes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Understanding consumer behaviour. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By getting data for every consumers\u2019 transaction, businesses can gain a better understanding of customer behaviour\u2014where they shop, how often the buyer needs replenishment, which other products the consumer is interested in, and other similar information. This allows manufacturers to know in which stores their specific products are selling high, so they\u2019re able to supply these stores with their best-selling items regularly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b>Helping the environment. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With less paper produced and needed, connected packaging helps reduce the overall environmental footprint. In some instances, connected packaging items are easy to dispose of and can be reused or recycled.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>What makes connected packaging work?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connected packaging operates within the ecosystem of the internet of things (IoT). This technological buzzword refers to the consolidation of real-time analytics, systems, sensors, and other types of interactive tools to track, monitor, collect data, as well as control, tangible objects.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these objects are capable of collecting and gathering information, allowing for two-way information exchange through the internet or other networks. An IoT device is connected to the internet through an IP network either through Ethernet\u2014wireless or wired\u2014or Bluetooth. Aside from artificial intelligence robots like Siri and Alexa, smartphones, smart cars, and smart homes are part of the IoT ecosystem, too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interactive packaging uses a mechanism that is embedded in the packaging itself that initiates information gathering and transmission. There are many ways in which information exchange may be initiated. It can be activated by the user, such as when a consumer scans <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beaconstac.com\/qr-code-generator\">QR codes<\/a>, taps their smartphone, or downloads and registers on an application. It can also be automatically activated depending on the manufacturers\u2019 preference. For example, it can activate when a special scanner is used or when a consumer opens the package.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common tools used to transmit wireless information include:\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID): <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connected packaging embedded with RFID tags allows consumers to connect to cloud-based applications. Upon activation or scanning, consumers are directed to a cloud service that offers interesting information and content related to the product.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Near-Field Communication (NFC):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The majority of smartphones can read and scan NFC tags, which in turn initiate mobile transactions.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Printed Codes: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Printed patterns, such as bar codes, QR codes, and images are the most classic of these options. Manufacturers can integrate various functionalities into QR codes, in particular, making them useful in interactive packaging.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2><b>The Bottom Line\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">current technologies incorporated in connected packaging, the business has better means to do the following:\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Track products real-time<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improve product inventory management<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure product authenticity and integrity<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enhance overall user experience<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These benefits allow consumers to receive added value from products that may be deemed as having the \u2018complete package.&#8217;<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"With the digital age, packaging has gone beyond protecting and preserving perishable goods, health and beauty items, household commodities, and so many other products.
