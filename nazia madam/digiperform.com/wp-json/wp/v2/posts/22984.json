Pick Your Area of Focus<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to be a successful freelancer, avoid the temptation to become a <em>&#8220;Jack (or Jane) of All Trades.&#8221;<\/em> <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a beginner, you might be willing to take any work that pays, but it&#8217;s better in the long run if you specialize or become an expert in a certain field.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Authorities, or experts, can charge more for their services so you won&#8217;t spend your time chasing after every dime. Like, if you have a good hand at writing, you can offer your content services or you like creating advertising campaigns, you can offer your services as a Campaign Manager.\u00a0<\/span>\r\nJoin will be all yours, just pick the area of your interest.\r\n<h2><strong>2. Clarify Your Service Offerings<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, spend some time on the front end clarifying what services you&#8217;re willing to offer. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much are you going to charge as a beginner? Do you want to charge for an hourly or project basis? The question is going to come up, so have the answer prepared in advance.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are going to build websites, will they only be in <em>WordPress<\/em> or other platforms such as <em>Drupal<\/em>? Are you going to create sites from scratch? Modify existing themes and templates? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These choices will impact your branding as well as the prices you&#8217;ll charge (more on that later).<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-16-at-1.19.05-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-22986 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-16-at-1.19.05-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"396\" \/><\/a>A market survey based on top 100 Upwork freelancers<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net\/blog\/web-business-ideas\/website-cost\/#4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">market survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the average <a href=\"https:\/\/thomasdigital.com\/website-design-pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"dofollow noopener noreferrer\">web development cost<\/a> is <em><strong>$31.64\/hour and the highest is $160\/hour<\/strong><\/em>. The gap is huge and you have to price yourself in the right range.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>3. Continue to Build Your Skills<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few people begin a digital marketing freelancing career with all of the skills they need to be successful. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key is knowing what you don&#8217;t know and then beginning to filling in the gaps. Whether that is working with mobile apps, SEO, WordPress, or basic grammar and AP rules, start building your skills so that you can compete in the online marketplace.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-16-at-1.19.36-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-22987 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-16-at-1.19.36-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like, Continue to groom yourself is necessary to stay competitive with <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/search-engine-optimization-course\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO course<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of resources that you can access online for both free and paid training.

Establish Yourself as A Brand.<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most important things you can do, and something many freelancers ignore to their detriment &#8211; <\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is to create a high-quality online presence. <\/span><\/em>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This begins with putting together a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designwizard.com\/blog\/creating-a-portfolio-website-pro-tips-to-do-it-right\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">top-notch portfolio site<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that highlights both your work and personality. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.buildthis.io\/how-to\/how-to-create-your-first-site-with-weebly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using site builders like Weebly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the quickest way to promote yourself online as a brand.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-16-at-1.19.47-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-22988 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-16-at-1.19.47-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"751\" height=\"368\" \/><\/a>Example of a freelance web designer portfolio website<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your website should give visitors enough information to get a sense of who you are as well as highlight past relevant work. You should also have your contact information prominently posted and keep this website updated as you have more projects to post.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your online presence also extends to social media since this is an excellent way to network and connect with potential clients. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">join LinkedIn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but don&#8217;t forget about the other social networks such as <em>Twitter<\/em> and any relevant freelance or industry groups on <em>Facebook<\/em>.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>5. Define Your Target Market.<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you decide that you&#8217;re willing to take paying work from anyone and anywhere, give this some careful thought. The truth is that some clients and types of jobs are going to take more time than others, which will impact the amount you can earn.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we spoke about defining your niche, this should also refer to what type of client you are willing to serve. Do you only want to work with startups, or do you prefer enterprise-sized companies? Do you want one-time jobs or long-term contracts?<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have this defined, you&#8217;ll be quicker to relate to new firms that fall within your wheelhouse. It will be easy to let them know that you understand their pain points and give them evidence that you&#8217;ve helped other companies like theirs find solutions.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>6. Keep Networking, Pitching, and Expanding.<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ll quickly learn the pain of losing a large client as a freelancer, so avoid placing all of your freelance eggs in just one or two baskets. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continue to diversify by working with multiple clients all around the World. When you do this, the loss of one won&#8217;t be nearly as painful.<\/span>\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-22989 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-16-at-1.19.59-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"751\" height=\"431\" \/><\/span><\/i>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can look for opportunity in the social platform like LinkedIn.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a ton of freelancing websites that you can sign up for and use to find clients. These include:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Upwork<\/strong><\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn Jobs<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearvoice.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ClearVoice<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FlexJobs<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mediabistro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Media Bistro<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">99designs<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>7. Last &#8211; Don&#8217;t Sell Yourself Short.<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I stated earlier, the charges vary depends on your skills and customer base. So, it can be a challenge to figure out how much to charge when other freelancers don&#8217;t publish their prices but don&#8217;t underprice your services just to get business.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;re offering a valuable service that is in high demand, so it&#8217;s essential that you charge a fair price that will also allow you to pay your bills.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you set your prices, figure out what you need to earn at a minimum to sustain your freelancing business. Start there and know that you can always increase your rates as you add value to your services over time.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these, reach out directly to companies within your chosen niche as you work to expand your client base.<\/span>\r\n<h4><strong>Conclusions<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the many benefits of working as a digital marketing freelancer is that it gives you the flexibility and freedom to work from anywhere with an internet connection. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, this job isn&#8217;t for everyone. As long as you have the skills and discipline necessary to stay motivated, organized, and produce quality work, you could have a successful and lucrative career as a freelancer.<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"If you&#8217;re ready to get serious about breaking away from traditional employment, here is how you can set yourself up to earn more like a digital marketing freelancer.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":35963,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[112],"tags":[503,504],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How to prepare yourself to make money as a Digital Marketing Freelancer?
