Recently, it has introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/blog\/post\/2018\/05\/25\/developer-business-tools-protect-privacy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">two new user privacy protection tools<\/span><\/a> aimed at helping developers and businesses to protect user \u2019s privacy and respond to the privacy requests in order to comply with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation has been updated, we have been receiving \u201cN\u201d numbers emailers stating that the company has updated the user\u2019s policy as per the updated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/gdpr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">GDPR<\/span><\/a>. By keeping the same update in mind, Facebook\u2019s latest addition to the tools&#8217; list will be effective by 1st July 2018. <\/span>\r\n<h4><b>About New User Privacy Protection Tools:<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ultimate aim to introduce these tools is to provide the application (apps) security under the regulation. They are providing the social network callback URL that can be used to automate people&#8217;s requests for their data to be deleted. Ideally, the user can remove the apps and websites from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/settings?tab=applications&amp;ref=settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Facebook\u2019s apps and website settings<\/span><\/a>; and can request to remove all the information that was received from them through Facebook. <\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/settings?tab=applications&amp;ref=settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-16757 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-30-at-7.39.46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"463\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: <em>The social network said in a blog post for developers, \u201cTo enable this option, they need users to provide them with a callback URL where they can send the request. The user can add the callback URL to app\u2019s Facebook Login settings page in the app dashboard. The user callback must use HTTPS.\u201d It will also provide users with a confirmation number which will act as a way to check the status of their request.<\/em><\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/tool.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-16758 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/tool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"573\" height=\"77\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, whenever we used any gaming or prediction application via Facebook; the application always asked for permission to log in to Facebook and allow to check your data for the results. After this update, the Facebook user can request or edit the settings to remove all the information that has been stored by the applications. (Again, Facebook is trying every do\u2019s n don\u2019ts to prove their point and best user experience after the Congressmen allegations.) <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, the developers can go to the Facebook Login settings page in the app dashboard and add the name, mailing address and email address for the DPO (Data Protection Officer), and that information will be available in users\u2019 apps and website settings.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>How to add\/get Data Protection Officer Contact Information?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is effective since May 25, 2018, requires certain companies that serve individuals in the EU. The purpose is to designate and publish contact information for a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who can assist with matters related to the processing of personal information. Therefore, Facebook is now helping a way out to easily provide this contact information to people.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you need to do is:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to your app&#8217;s Facebook Login Settings page<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the app dashboard to add your DPO&#8217;s name (optional), mailing address, and email address. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/tool2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-16759 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/tool2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"659\" height=\"398\" \/><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can view the information as it will be made available in people&#8217;s apps and website settings. They can contact their DPO\u2019s if they have questions about how their data is processed and used.<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Facebook Friday introduced two new tools aimed at helping developers respond to the privacy concerns of their applications\u2019 users and comply with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect 1st July 2018.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":36403,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[29],"tags":[278,279],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 -
