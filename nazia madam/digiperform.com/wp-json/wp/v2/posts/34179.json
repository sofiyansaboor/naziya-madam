Or at least choose your own route for it?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People are job-hopping more than ever. Platforms like Fiverr make the gig economy stronger than ever. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Plus, ever since we\u2019ve all started working from home, we discovered that it\u2019s actually quite cool to manage yourself, your time, and your projects\u2014without someone physically looking over your shoulder.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unsurprisingly, a lot more people are finally discovering their entrepreneurial side, either by starting side-projects, or even by just taking the dive without any floaties like a permanent contract at a job they secretly hate.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Are you also ready to take that plunge, but not sure yet in what direction to jump? You don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, you could just take parts of your current job and start doing that independently\u2014like many social media managers turned freelance copywriters do. But maybe you\u2019re looking to do a complete 180, and want a job that fits the times we live in, matches with your passions, and doesn&#8217;t feel like a job at all, actually.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u2019re not going to tell you how virtual assistants are in great demand and that dog sitting is fun. Instead, we\u2019ve gathered 12 creative and fun ideas to inspire your entrepreneurial adventure. Ready to go?<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. Become a crypto coach<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Are you one of those people who somehow understand cryptocurrencies\u2014and maybe even NFTs\u2014and have you been successfully investing in all the right coins? That\u2019s a great way to make an (extra) income.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But what if you could do more with all that knowledge? People are reading up about it, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s a lot more comforting when someone actually tells you how and when to buy.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let\u2019s say, you know all about how to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moonpay.com\/buy\/btc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">buy BTC on Moonpay<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, or any other type of bitcoin. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You could become a one-on-one coach about this, or even create an online course, to make this side-hustle all the more scalable.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h3>2. Start an at-home cooking service<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do your friends and family often come over to devour your food? Are you a master at meal prepping and making something amazing from the weirdest leftovers someone has in their fridge?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then you\u2019re lucky, first of all. Many people struggle to come up with a pasta dish that isn&#8217;t the same as yesterday\u2019s (and the ten days before) if they even have time to cook at all.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, you might not want to become a professional chef and spend most of your nights and weekends in a kitchen. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You could consider starting a delivery service, but that would mean you\u2019d spend more time driving around than cooking\u2014and you want to do what you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">love<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So if you\u2019re a talented cook, consider starting a local business where you go to other people&#8217;s houses to meal prep. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can opt to do the groceries and create meals for the entire week in their kitchen\u2014which also saves you your own kitchen and sanity.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While this is a little of an upscale type of service, there are surely plenty of people around who are tired of the same old take-away every day and would love to try your fresh food!<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>3. Make yourself a hyper-specialized social media expert<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Right, social media marketing isn&#8217;t necessarily the most original job. But the big boys aren&#8217;t looking for generalists anymore, anyway. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Their Instagram and LinkedIn are up and running, they just want to turn it into a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">success<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. So if you know how to use any platform like no one else, offer that as a service.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For instance, offer engagement services for Instagram. Or help people write great LinkedIn pages. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The more specific it gets, the easier it\u2019ll become to sell to people who already know what they\u2019re doing\u2014but acknowledge they need your help.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>4. Become a remote work trainer<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019ve been a digital nomad since before 2020, or you adapted incredibly easily, you\u2019ve got a lot of valuable skills to teach others.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A lot of people who are used to cubicles or trendy open-plan offices are still struggling with managing remote work. Which means their employers are also struggling with that.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can sell yourself to organizations as a remote work coach who will help them get the most out of their current employees, teaching them healthy ways to manage their work-life balance and boost their productivity.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>5. Sell yourself as an ergonomic expert<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Continuing on the previous point: a lot of people think they&#8217;ve got their home office routine completely under control. Meanwhile, they sound like a firecracker every time they get up for another cup of coffee. But no, they\u2019re fine.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019ve been working as a physiotherapist or in any other related field, and know a thing or two about working in a healthy position, market yourself to people who are working from home and don&#8217;t want to break their backs in the process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the right value proposition and laser-targeted market, plus maybe some referral deals and affiliate marketing with furniture stores, this could be a rather profitable business\u2014and you\u2019ll do a little good for others as well.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h3>6. Finally start that food truck!<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No, this is not the time to recommend anyone to open a restaurant, we\u2019re well aware. But if it&#8217;s always been a dream of yours, and you don&#8217;t like to be at the same place all the time anyway, why not open a food truck?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Admittedly, this is not a new concept, but it&#8217;s still a booming business, and perfectly fits the time we live in of outdoor events and being flexible. You could even use it to travel a little further and further because your market will simply be wherever you go.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h3>7. Travel planner for digital nomads<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oddly specific, right? That\u2019s just how we like it.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ever since remote work is becoming more accepted and standardized, people are dipping their toes into actual travel and work, instead of working from home.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But if you think choosing a holiday destination is difficult, wait until you have to find a destination that has fast enough Wi-Fi to zoom your boss, has plenty of coworking spaces or at least coffee places that won&#8217;t kick you out when you type too loud.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A lot of digital nomads have been there, done that, and if that\u2019s you, consider helping people find their way in this world.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You could create guides on specific places and sell them, or make it all the more personal (and valuable!) by becoming a personal travel planner. You could even offer this service to companies who are encouraging their employees to use this time to explore the world while still getting the job done, for even more impact.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>8. Become <i>that<\/i> specialized tour guide in your own city<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Live in a pretty place and know all about it? Now that tourism is starting to come back, you could use this coincidence to make a little money\u2014while also getting out of the house.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, there are plenty of standard businesses you could join to become a generic tour guide, pointing at the landmarks nobody was going to miss anyway. But with your specific, personal touch to it, you could make it into a little business too.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For instance, maybe you know all the best wine bars in your city, and you can create a tour around that. Or you were an enthusiastic dater in your early twenties and can show couples the most romantic spots in town.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Make it quirky, and make it specific. You could create tours especially for the elderly, or for families with kids. Market yourself in relevant places and start walking!<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>9. Sell your photos as a stock photographer<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Have you always loved photography, and do you have countless pictures that are great\u2014but not really useful for you? Sell them as stock photos!\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, this will probably <a href=\"https:\/\/www.printful.com\/sell-art-online\">start out as a small side gig<\/a>, but it&#8217;s nonetheless a lot of fun and gives you some reward for your creative work. You can upload your work on websites like Unsplash or Pexels and start earning money every time someone uses your photo. If things are looking up, you can even become more independent and start your own website.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the amount of content that is being created every, well, minute, there&#8217;s a huge demand for stock footage, and anyone who frequently has to find that knows the most-used pictures by heart\u2014so give them a fresh set of pictures!<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h3>Dream big, but do bigger<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As you can see, there\u2019s a wide variety of options out there if you want to start a business. No matter how niche your passion is, you can turn it into a little more than that, even if it would just be to make a passive income from selling courses about your knitting obsession.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re looking to double down on yourself and the opportunities out there nowadays, you\u2019ll probably like this podcast on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/resources.audiense.com\/blog\/podcast-data-stories-leaders-at-work-gaelle-bertrand\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">developing yourself by seizing opportunities when they arrive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, too.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>About the author<\/h4>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/vickyfrissen\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vicky Frissen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a freelance copywriter based in Barcelona.
