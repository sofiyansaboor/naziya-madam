This is an issue that has affected many businesses, and it has caused them to shut down.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article will tell you about the five biggest UX mistakes that turn your users off. Knowing what these are will help you avoid making these mistakes and learn what you should not do when designing the UX of your product.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>5 Biggest UX Mistakes Turning Your Users Off<\/h3>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4>Not Using Responsive Design<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responsive design is necessary, and you cannot avoid it. If your website doesn\u2019t have a responsive design, then it will not be successful. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without responsive design, users will be irritated when using your product, and you need to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen. People use various devices every day, and if your websites cannot be displayed on different devices and screen sizes, they will fail.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a UX mistake that new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tvisha.com\/blog\/difference-between-ui-and-uxwhich-comes-first\">UX designers<\/a> can make, setting them up for failure. You need to know that responsive design is not a trend, and it needs to be a part of all of your designs. UX design consultant firms like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/clay.global\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will tell you how important this is and ask you to make it a fundamental part of UX design.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have already started designing your website and haven\u2019t added responsive design, then you need to start again and add it in. If you don\u2019t have experience doing this, hire UX design consultant firms and use their UX services to help you create the best designs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never design your websites without making them responsive. You need to remember this and use it in all of your designs.<\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4>Using Carousels In Your Design<\/h4>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/blog\/carousel-slider-design-best-practices\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carousels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have become a popular design trend, and designers are adding them to their website design without a good reason. This design trend doesn\u2019t add value to the website that the user can benefit from.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It doesn\u2019t need to be a carousel; you need to consider why you are adding something to the design and if it\u2019s giving the user any value. Let\u2019s focus on carousels in this article and use them as an example.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s talk about the disadvantages of carousels in your website\u2019s design.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They distract the user from the other content that is on the screen.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The user will need to navigate the carousel to find the information they want.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carousels aren\u2019t giving the user any value. The information can be presented in a different way that is less distracting.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website\u2019s design can look cluttered if the carousel isn\u2019t in the right place.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would help if you looked at these issues when adding anything new to your website\u2019s design. Don\u2019t just add something because it might look good. Think about how it helps the user.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to use a carousel in the <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/importance-of-web-design-development-in-digital-marketing-strategy\/\">design<\/a>, you need to make it essential. Give users control, don\u2019t make it automatic. Present information that users will want to know more about. This will cause them to click on the carousel and visit other pages of your website.<\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4>Not Thinking About The Mobile User Experience<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people use their mobiles to visit websites. This is why it\u2019s essential to ensure your website\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/the-importance-of-user-experience-for-digital-marketing\/\">mobile user experience<\/a> is excellent. New designers can make this mistake, and it causes users to be frustrated and leave the website. When this happens, they will not return and instead use a different website.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s talk about what you should do when designing your website for mobile.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rearrange the content and elements on your website to make them easier to see on smaller screen sizes.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make buttons larger, so users don\u2019t have a hard time clicking them to navigate your website.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove content that isn\u2019t important. You have less space; you need to keep what the user is looking for and remove everything else.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simplify the navigation. Make it easier for people to navigate the website.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test your website on different screen sizes and improve to give users the best experience. If you need help designing for mobile, use the UX services that UX design agencies offer.<\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4>Discounting Usability<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX design needs to be usable. You need to ensure that your design puts <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.interaction-design.org\/literature\/topics\/usability\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usability<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before the visuals. If it doesn\u2019t, this can cause people to have a bad experience when using your website and cause them to leave after a negative first impression.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many products fail because they have poor usability. You need to make sure your website isn\u2019t one of them. Understand who your users are and what they want from your product. This is what you should be focusing on.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at similar products and identify how usable they are. Do they make it easier for users to achieve their goals? If they don\u2019t, then why would people want to use them? Learn from this mistake and avoid it in your designs.<\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4>Not Simplifying<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/6-steps-to-write-a-perfect-website-design-brief-2\/\">Designers<\/a> need to simplify their designs. You need to keep what\u2019s essential to the user and remove everything else. A cluttered design will cause users to leave the website, and you don\u2019t want this happening to you. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out what users want and give them that. Everything else doesn\u2019t need to be there. If it\u2019s just taking up space and not giving users any value, why is it in your design?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing this requires understanding your users and what they want from your product. Research thoroughly before you start designing the UX of your website. This is how you can create great designs that people want to interact with.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]The user experience of your product is essential, and not focusing on it enough will cause the product to fail.
