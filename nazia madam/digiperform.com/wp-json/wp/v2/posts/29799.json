On the one hand, you know that a huge investment in marketing is likely to land you a slew of new customers that\u2019ll pay back that investment with a large return. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, you have other plates to keep spinning, and it can be difficult to justify directing meager resources towards marketing. As such, this guide is all about how to invest small to get big returns in the digital marketing space \u2013\u00a0saving money but still kicking on and securing more customers online.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2>1. SEO<b>\r\n<\/b><b><\/b><\/h2>\r\n<b>\r\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s begin with your website. It\u2019s here that you\u2019re able to curate all of your content, your pages, your sitemap, and your calls to action to suit your marketing needs. And one of the biggest changes that you can make to your website that costs no extra fee is to boost its SEO ranking, ensuring that more consumers searching for your products or services find your website via Google. SEO can be boosted by:<\/span><b><\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/248302\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blog<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and using keywords that Google will spot and link to web users searching for those same words<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add high-quality content, like videos and pictures, which is favored by Google\u2019s algorithm\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your website is linking to other high-quality websites, which shows Google you\u2019re a firm and a website to trust<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, curate backlinks to your website from other reputable websites, which will show you\u2019re trusted around the web<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/seo-guide\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beginner at SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s worth investing in a short crash course to help you understand the benefits of this approach. It\u2019ll help you generate organic traffic that doesn\u2019t cost a penny.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>2. Social Media<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/why-social-media-marketing-is-important-for-businesses-in-2021\/\">Social media<\/a> came along at just the right time for small businesses or those with a small digital marketing budget. Instead of having to take up arms against the big guns in your industry, you can instead quietly plug your business on social media to those followers and their friends that you\u2019re most interested in reaching. You\u2019ll do this in two ways: with organic follows (those who find you online) and paid ones (those you target via the advertising mechanisms on social media).\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic follows are difficult to amass and usually rely on you having wonderful social media pages that share great content. It\u2019s far easier to gather these followers if you\u2019re a sealife park \u2013 if you sell curtains, you\u2019re unlikely to get much traction on social media. But if you are a certain business, a little spending, targeting people you think are likely to be renovating their home, could turn up a huge untapped number of customers for your brand.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be aware that different social media platforms charge different prices and that the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/manychat.com\/blog\/instagram-ads-cost\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram ads cost<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could be more effective for your brand than advertising on Facebook \u2013\u00a0especially if you\u2019re targeting a younger audience.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>3. Influencers<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of social media, there is a third way to get followers, and that\u2019s by partnering with influencers. Again, this might not work for the curtains business: there are only so many ways to make curtains exciting for a young <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/best-digital-marketing-strategies-that-will-catch-audience-attraction\/\">social media audience<\/a>. However, suppose you\u2019re in the cosmetics or apparel business. In that case, this is something that you absolutely must try: it can help you boost your reach exponentially if you partner with the right influencers.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increasingly, firms are targeting medium-sized profiles for promotional purposes. The larger ones charge huge rates with diminishing returns, but those with a few thousand followers are more likely not to be trusted and admired by those on social media and will ask for less cash to promote your products. Some might even do it for a free sample alone. Just be careful here that you sign a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.sharelov.com\/how-to-work-with-influencers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contract<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in line with laws and regulations.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>4. Banner Ads<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some businesses for which banner ads are incredibly effective and others for which you\u2019ll find you get very little traction at all. Often, you\u2019ll know instinctively if this form of digital marketing is for you. But if you don\u2019t, here\u2019s an example of what works and what doesn\u2019t:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you sell unique protein shakes and your banner ad is on a workout website, it\u2019s going to get clicks, and it\u2019ll certainly secure sales<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you sell the same product, but your banner ad is on more general lifestyle blogs, you\u2019re unlikely to get any interest<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you sell a product that people don\u2019t tend to buy on a whim \u2013\u00a0like those aforementioned curtains \u2013\u00a0you\u2019ll probably not fare well with banner ads<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that banner ad are seen as annoying by most web users, so if you engage in this form of advertising, you need to be sure that users will take <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2020\/03\/02\/banner-ads-examples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an active interest <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in what\u2019s being advertised. If they don\u2019t, you\u2019ll just be another annoying pop-up.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>5. Video Marketing<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, this is one of the forms of marketing that continues to skyrocket in popularity as more and more web users turn to video content as their favored way of consuming information. <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.comp\/the-new-rules-for-youtube-marketing-2018\/\">YouTube<\/a> is the perfect platform in this respect, as you can be found via multiple channels, and you\u2019ll be able to promote your video, if you wish, to target certain users with certain viewing habits.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue with making a video that hits home with consumers is that you\u2019ll need it to be high quality, and producing a high-quality video takes time and resources \u2013 and a hefty investment of cash. Still, if this video is something that\u2019ll show off your brand for years to come, it may well be worth that initial investment.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos that show off something unique and exciting about a product or company work especially well. Think of those videos of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/insiderpaper.com\/video-robot-dog-public-street\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">robotic dogs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that do the rounds on social media: millions if not billions of people are aware of the lab that produced them. That\u2019s the power of a great marketing video: people share it far and wide, with huge promotional potential for your brand.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital marketing is a difficult priority to balance with the rest of your business objectives. But if you take account of the methods outlined here, you should be able to attract new customers to your brand without breaking the bank as we head towards 2022 and a year of new opportunities for your business.\u00a0<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Digital marketing is a difficult game to play.
