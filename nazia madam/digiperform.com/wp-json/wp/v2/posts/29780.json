Most people even have to wait almost a year and more to experience results after implementing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques.

So, keeping this in mind, if you are looking forward to increasing your visibility on Google, this post contains some tips and strategies that can help you out with the process.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1><b>Defining Search Engine Visibility<\/b><\/h1>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-39086 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/unnamed-11.jpeg\" alt=\"Google Search Engine\" width=\"626\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/unnamed-11.jpeg 512w, https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/unnamed-11-300x142.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.payoneer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/10-tips-improve-seo.jpg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/blog.payoneer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/10-tips-improve-seo.jpg<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as SEO visibility or search visibility, it is a factor that refers to the share of traffic that a site acquires from ranking higher in the organic search result.

Sure, you can come up with keyword-integrated ads and have a high-quality score, but that is not enough. You must also pay attention to on-page SEO.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure every page of the site precisely targets a certain topic. This means you can conduct in-depth keyword research to find relevant, high-volume phrases and keywords to integrate the same on pages and in the meta tags. The more targeted and specific the web page, the higher will be the chances to improve the overall visibility and get noticed.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>2.

Every blog post is a chance to get noticed and rank for an extensive set of keywords. However, if you are going to start a blog merely to add additional pages to the site, avoid committing this blunder. Google notices blog posts and lets users visit them because they offer relevant, helpful, and reliable advice or information. If your blog is trusted, it increases your brand\u2019s value.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>3. Use Attractive Titles<\/b><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By implementing keywords to the pages\u2019 titles of your site will help both the searchers and Google to identify them. However, your objective should be to get noticed and not only identified. To get discovered, you must create compelling and attractive titles so as to stand out. But, make sure you don\u2019t overdo it in any manner. Furthermore, keep in mind that your titles should be captivating and clear, and not desperate.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>4.

It adds new pages to the index and updates the profile of existing web pages. Therefore, the easier it will make it for Google to navigate through your site and learn what is required, the quicker it will add you to the index and retrieve the same for searches. This simply means you will have to:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run a technical SEO audit to make sure there are no holes in the indexation<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internally link the pages of your website so as to make your site more authoritative and easier to crawl<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insert relevant keywords in the image tags, meta description, URL, and meta titles of your website pages.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>5. Make Use of Local Media<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An array of local media outlets will provide you with mentions in the publications. These outlets either charge a reasonable fee or do so completely free of charge. If you don\u2019t mind shedding a few bucks, you can go for out-of-home advertising. To do so, you can reach out to local news channels, radio stations, magazines, and local papers and communicate an interesting story about your brand. This will help direct traffic to the site. Furthermore, placing ads in local publications and newspapers will assist you in getting newcomers to the site.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>6.

However, if you wish more people to get you noticed, you must rank higher. And, the key way to grab a higher place on SERP is quality. You cannot get to a desirable place through any shortcuts.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google considers the time that visitors spend on your website. Also, whether users are navigating to other pages on your site before exiting is also being noticed. Thus, you can follow:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diving deeper into topics and answering common questions linked to your keywords<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>7.

Yes, that is quite possible. To do so, you would have to use attractive images, compelling content, and relevant topics to maximize your posts\u2019 appeal.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if you are tagging or linking a brand into your post, make sure you let them know through an email or social media. This will allow them to notice your content and share the same on their social media platforms and with their own followers. This will lead to a snowball of reposts that will help you cast an extensive virtual net.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>8. Add Your Site to Online Directories<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another significant method to increase the visibility on Google is to get registered on online directories. There are plenty of online platforms where you can create a profile and add your site. The more places you enlist your business at, the more frequently you will get noticed. Some of the widely common websites include:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LocalGuides<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foursquare<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Angieslist<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yelp<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CitySearch<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google My Business\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more!<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>9.

If you want Google to crawl the pages efficiently, you must get verified by Google. For this, you can submit the business to Google My Business and Google Maps. Here are some steps to do so:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create an account on Google My Business<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locate your business on Google Maps and claim the same<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is as easy as it can be. The last step would be to wait for a physical verification code that you will receive in the mail. You would have to enter the code in your Google My Business profile for verification.

It is not necessary to promote your business each time you post something. A good rule of thumb is to upload only 20% of promotional posts. The rest of them could be guides and other types of content to keep your users engaged. Also, it is even essential to be actively engaged on social media to make your posts stand out.
