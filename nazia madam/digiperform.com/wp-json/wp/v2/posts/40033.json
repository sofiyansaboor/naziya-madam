The Basic PPC Interview Questionnaire for Freshers.<\/h4><\/div><\/div><\/div>[\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;16px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong>1. What is PPC marketing?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPPC (Pay Per Click) is a way to drive and turn traffic to a website through Search engines and partner websites. It is a type of internet marketing which involves advertisers paying a fee each time their ads are clicked, the advertisers only have to pay if a visitor visits or clicks on their ads.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Describe AdWords in brief?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAdwords is an online procedure by Google to help businesses promote their products and services through search engines and associated websites. Through certain defined Adwords, you can place a text ad that appears when somebody searches for terms or phrases associated with your services or product.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Explain how Adwords work?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe whole Adwords system is based on bids and proposals. If you place a higher bidding price, definitely your ads are going to appear on the top of the search engine result pages. And as stated we all know that Adwords works on clicks which means you only have to pay the bidding or proposed amount if a person clicks on your ad.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Which settings you cannot change after an Ad account is created?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Currency and Time Zone settings cannot be changed or edited after creating an ad account.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. What is Quality Score?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nQuality Score is an algorithm that is calculated for each keyword between 1 to 10. The Quality Score defines the quality of keywords compared with Ads and Landing Page. This algorithm is used to calculate the AdRank, which is used to calculate the position your ads would be placed.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. What is the impact of the Quality score on CPC and Ad Position?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nQuality Score is inversely proportional to CPC and directly proportional to Ad Position. That means higher the QS the benefit would be lower cost and higher ad position.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. What is Actual CPC?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt is the actual cost of a click for an advertiser in an auction. The actual CPC is calculated in real-time making it nearly impossible to calculate the Actual CPC, but we can calculate the Avg. CPC.\r\n\r\nActual CPC = (AdRank to Beat\/QS)+$0.01\r\n\r\n<strong>8. What Kind of Quality Score can you achieve for keywords?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn my past campaigns, I was able to achieve a QS ranging from 7 \u2013 10, but definitely, I can advance the quality score by using optimization techniques in ad campaigning.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. What are the Factors which affect Quality Score?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nQuality Score depends on the following logarithms\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>CTR of the Keyword<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The significance of Keywords and Ads<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Landing Page Quality<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Historic Account Data<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>10. How can you Improve Conversion Rates?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nConversion rates can be improved by creating ads that match rightly with the keywords and by creating compactly themed ad groups so that we can get targeted users to the best landing page.\r\n\r\nBy improving the Landing Page quality, also the conversions can be improved.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Can PPC Advertising affect the ranking of websites on search engines?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNo, not possible as the Search Engines never mix them. Google and other search engines rank both organic and PPC results separately.\r\n\r\n<strong>12. Can you tell me the limit of the character used for PPC Ads?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nExpanded Text Ads limit the uses as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>30 Characters \u2013 Headline 1<\/li>\r\n \t<li>30 Characters \u2013 Headline 2<\/li>\r\n \t<li>80 characters \u2013 Descriptions.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nStandard Ads has the limitation of a maximum of 25 for headlines 1 and 2 combined. 70 for descriptions\r\n\r\n<strong>13. What is an Invalid Click and how does Google determines the invalid clicks?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nInvalid clicks are fake clicks, termed unintentional and malicious software clicks. Google has a refined mechanism and algorithms to automatically detect and filter invalid clicks from the users&#8217; accounts.\r\n\r\n<strong>14. What are PLA Ads (Shopping Ads)?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPLA (Product Listing Ads), is an ad strategy used to advertise product ads on Google search and associated partners. This campaign is also called a Shopping campaign mostly since it is mostly used by E-commerce websites.\r\n\r\n<strong>15. What is meant by Converted Clicks?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nConverted click is a metric that tracks the total no of clicks which resulted in conversions. This metric is criticized and not entertained by Google.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h4 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">2.

What is the Re-marketing Audience and how to generate this list?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe re-marketing audience is the users who visit our websites, by using the Google remarketing tag on our website, we can add the users we wish to our audience list.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. When can the CPV be charged for an in-stream ad for a video of 60 seconds in length?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA CPV can only be charged If the user watches at least 30 seconds of the published video.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. What is meant by Search Terms?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSearch Terms are the exact keywords for which your ads were triggered or generated.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. What is meant by Price Extensions?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPrice extensions are a new format of extension, intended to display the price of the relevant products.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. What are Affiliate Locations Extensions (ALEs)?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nALEs are special extensions that link the location. These extensions are useful for brands to display the names of retail stores where the product is available offline.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. How will you manage the Google Quality Score?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nGoogle\u2019s Quality Score is based on three things:\r\n\r\n1- keywords\r\n\r\n2-ad text\r\n\r\n3- landing page relevance.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the highest score possible, it\u2019s best to use fewer keywords and targeted ad groups. This way, we can write more targeted copy that will more likely find its position. PPC experts should be well-known with Quality Scores, how they work and how they improve the quality (with all these in mind sometimes, you may not even want to focus on Quality scores.)\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Can you explain how the Google auction works?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nDigiperform &#8211; Google Auction works\r\n\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-40034\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/blog-300x73.png\" alt=\"Digiperform - Google Auction works\" width=\"399\" height=\"97\" srcset=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/blog-300x73.png 300w, https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/blog.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe auction process goes like this:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>When a user enters a search, AdWord pulls out all the ads with relevant keywords matching that particular search.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>From these ads, those which are not eligible, such as ads that target a different country or specific ads that have been disapproved, will be ignored.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>From the ads remaining, only those with a high enough Ad Rank will be shown as results.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nSince It\u2019s a crucial stage of your campaign, make sure anyone who is involved with it knows the process and how to get the most out of it.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. How does Ad Rank affect the cost per click (CPC)<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to charging the CPC (the actual amount you\u2019re charged per click), at the most you will end up paying the minimum amount required to hold your ad on the position.\r\n\r\nIn the Search Network, ads that appear above the search results generally have a higher CPC than those that appear below the results.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. What is click-through rate (CTR), and how is it calculated?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Click-through rate (CTR) is a ratio that shows how many people are clicking on your ad after seeing it. It is calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions. The total number of clicks is divided by the total number of impressions = click-through rate.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_empty_space][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h4 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">3.

What are some things you can do using the Google AdWords API, and would you recommend using it?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhile the AdWords API offers a variety of tools and functions. It&#8217;s highly recommended that it should only be used by those with dedicated business services and needs that can\u2019t be met through other AdWords tools. It should always be ensured and kept in mind to hire an expert who knows when to call in the API \u2014 and when not to.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. What third-party tools do you use for keyword discovery?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOutside of Google\u2019s own search query, there are plenty of tools to help discover new and related keywords. A few of them are listed below:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Google Keyword Planner Tool.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>SpyFu.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>SEMrush.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Bing Keyword Research Tool.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nGoogle also offers a comprehensive exam to test your Display Network knowledge which only an expert can ace.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Why is it recommended to separate Display Network campaigns from Search Network campaigns?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe answer may vary by campaign, as Google explains that different campaign settings can be more effective on different networks.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. What is the On-Schedule Indicator (OSI)?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe On-schedule indicator takes the traffic-shaped ad server goals into account and will represent a more accurate measure of the delivery status. It is recommended for networks that are enabled to pace based on expected traffic,\r\n\r\n<strong>5. How long should advertisers wait after creating a new display campaign before analyzing its performance?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs Google recommends it should be for two to three weeks. But it depends from campaign to campaign.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. What do manage placements allow advertisers to do?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe managed placement allows the advertisers to Bid differently for specific placements on the Google Display Network.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. What are the benefits of remarketing?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA person who is an expert in PPC marketing should be familiar with remarketing and able to outline its many benefits, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Targeting users when they\u2019re most likely to buy.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Lists are created for specific purposes.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Large-scale reach.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>8. Is my site well equipped to handle tracking requirements to ensure that remarketing campaign works?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn order to know whether your site is well equipped to handle tracking requirements, you should ensure that the site is able to support the required pixels or codes, even before you begin your remarketing campaign.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. What are the most important KPIs to measure success?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRemarketing, like any other campaign, comes with a set of metrics to keep track of. These include CTR, cost per click (CPC), effective cost per acquisition (eCPM) and return on investment (ROI). Before you start, make sure you know what your goal is and which key performance indicators (KPIs) best reflects it.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. What types of remarketing are there, and which is best for my campaign?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRemarketing is not a size that fits all the users, within the ad type itself, there are many options including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Site remarketing.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Search remarketing.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Email remarketing.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Social media remarketing.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>11. Which audience segment should I target?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you decide on the type of remarketing, the next step is choosing a segment. As an expert, you should be able to tell the difference between general visitors, specific product visitors, previous customers etc. and which one is the most appropriate process applicable for the given campaign.\r\n\r\n<strong>12. Should I use a list automatically created by AdWords?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhen we initially create a remarketing campaign, AdWords will automatically create a default list for you to use. Now by this, you can choose to create a website remarketing list on your own.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]The term Interview in itself creates anxiety in our mind, especially when it comes to the technical side of the interview.
