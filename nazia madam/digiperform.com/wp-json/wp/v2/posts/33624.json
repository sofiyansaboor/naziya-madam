Now, still, have doubts on how website design &amp; development can be a real savior to your digital marketing efforts? Let\u2019s deep dive into these explanations.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Core Components of Effective Web Design &amp; Development<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as the saying goes, the first impression is the best, a website is a point that creates the first impression in the minds of customers. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It lets you make a safe and secure step towards effective customer communication through a user-friendly and professional website design and careful website development.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great website has core elements to be taken care of such as navigation structure, color scheme, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/avivdigital.in\/page-speed-seo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">optimization for speed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, layout, search engine optimization (SEO), conversion rate optimization (CRO), content, graphics, etc. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses don&#8217;t consider the fact that the website design and development is a segment of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agorapulse.com\/blog\/ecommerce-marketing-tools\/\">digital marketing plan<\/a>, or that they should have the best look, purpose, and feel just like other advertising methods involved in digital marketing just like PPC (pay-per-click) advertising.<\/span>\r\n<h3>Web Design elements contributing to Digital Marketing Strategy<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the factors of website design that contribute to your digital marketing plan to let you achieve your business goals successfully.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO is a major factor behind website design concerns. Even though people say that the design elements don&#8217;t impact the rankings of the website, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/changing-web-layout-can-affect-search-rankings\/382700\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has already said that website layout changes can affect the search engine rankings of that particular website.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another factor is checking for content duplication. The Search engine algorithm is aligned strongly with the digital marketing plan. Make sure that the content you use for your website is unique and not duplicate content, to maintain search engine friendliness. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duplicated content can be caught by Google and this inhibits your page from ranking in the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Along with the design, it is also necessary to incorporate the back-end design with meta tags, meta description, alt tags, etc.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the best SEO-friendly website design of 2019 was grabbed by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spinxdigital.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spinx Digital<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where the designers and developers have made this highly responsive website with simple, vivid backgrounds, along with excellent typography and quick loading times. Additionally, the informative content and rich graphics have also contributed to the SEO friendliness of the website.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the best website design, you also invoke great conversion rates. If the website looks neat and feels reliable to the end-user, then it is more likely for the prospect to purchase the product or service from your website or perform a specific action. The Authority and simplicity of a website lead to the ultimate success of a website design.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complex designs can create confusion among the consumers, hence it is better to avoid making designs complicated to achieve great functionality. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complex designs can make the website speed too slow, which makes people lose patience and interest in staying on your website, and chances are that you end up losing valuable customers. Let your website be simple for a desirable user experience and complex to a certain extent that satisfies Conversion rates.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and foremost thing that should come to your mind while creating a website, is to have customers or end-users in mind. Ensure that your website is user-friendly, else you fail in gaining enough traffic.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website design affects the user experience for the visitors. Make sure that the website design is easy for navigation and it is easy to click on the website links. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, ensure that the loading speed of your website is high. Consider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/acodez.in\/website-optimization-techniques-local-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website optimization<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for both computer and mobile devices to ensure that consumers get a seamless experience across these platforms. Avoid large images which can make website loading slow.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the best website design of 2019 was that of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/matruecannabis.com\/en\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MA True Cannabis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website. The orange theme and youthful vibe of the website give a visual treat to the visitors. It also deploys a combination of 3-D visuals and floating attributes that maintain powerful user engagement and e-commerce experiences to bestow seamless functionality.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Analytics &amp; Reporting Tools<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A website left as it is doesn&#8217;t serve you any better. The journey of a website has many steps, it needs to continuously adapt, optimize, take corrective actions, and evolve as per the changing requirements of users. Now how to find the required changes and consider them to make your site more responsive?\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analytics is a simple solution to this problem. Make sure that the website has the best setup and reliable analytics tools are used to collect the data such as user behavior, purchase patterns, bounce rate, conversion rate, and other metrics. You can use tools like Google Analytics to effectively measure and monitor these constraints.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>Branding<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website design can easily evoke vibes for the consumers. People figure out the goodness of a website with the way they appear to be at first sight. If a design gives negative feelings to the users then chances are that they avoid your website leaving your brand hopeless.\u00a0 As users land your website, they build a perception of your brand. Make sure that your brand conveys the correct message to your consumers. Consider logo, font, color, images, and content to keep your website interesting.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Why Web Design &amp; Development is So Important in Digital Marketing<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website represents the products or services you offer to your customers.

It says that if there exist more choices for people to choose, the more time they take to come to a decision. Design experts keep this law while reducing the number of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/acowebs.com\/ecommerce-call-to-action\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call-to-actions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or cluttering with too much information.\u00a0 <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They always consider making website design crisp and simple that involves merging similar categories into a single menu option.
