Sure, it was simpler back then. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the rise of current game consoles favorites, like Nintendo Switch and PS5, the best way to pass the time is by playing computer games on your PC. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from games that you can easily search online, most of the games that we used to play in the early 2000s are also free! This is what we call \u2018flash games.\u2019 We remember flash games as very straightforward when it comes to the game premise, simple graphics, and are in 2D.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the word itself, flash games were intended to play for only a short period of time and can be accessed via a browser. This means that you don\u2019t need to download any application, software, or plug-in just to enjoy a good old flash game. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flash games are typically small in file size compared to those intensive video games we know now, like Animal Crossing and Grand Theft Auto. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flash games will only take a few minutes to finish one round or session. If you are done with a flash game, you can still choose from hundreds of other games in the catalog.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Flash games have revolutionized the video games industry\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0As we all know, flash games are the foundation and blueprint of a lot of video games that we know today. But how did it all start? Way back in 1996, the flash player was invented for the sole purpose of animation and graphics. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after a few years, in 2000, developers started to use the programming language to create online games. Thus, the birth of flash games. Some flash games that may be familiar to you are Pacman, Tetris, Bejeweled, Canabalt, Space Invaders, and more!<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sadly, after 20 years of being a tech staple, Adobe flash player will be phased out in December 2020. This means that a huge number of flash games will be also wiped out from the web forever. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t worry though! You will still be able to access your favorite flash games. Even though flash games were originally made to play via browser, you can actually download your favorite flash games on your PC.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>How to download flash games?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest cons of playing flash games is that you won\u2019t be able to use them without an internet connection.
