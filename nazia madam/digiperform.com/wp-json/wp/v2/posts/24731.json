There is no use of an <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/nourish-business-digital-marketing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">effecting digital marketing strategy<\/a> if your website is not user-friendly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>User Experience Is Not Just about Interfaces<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s not a single soul that could argue the importance of intuitive and effective interface when it comes to guaranteeing user experience. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the only important UX component. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interface only represents one of the ways that the technology uses to communicate with users. Basically, user experience defines the bond between users and technology. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the continuous development of different technologies, users\u2019 needs are constantly increasing and that\u2019s the main thing UX has to deal with.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Usability and User Experience Are Different<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often people say that user experience represents usability. Even though <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.interaction-design.org\/literature\/article\/usability-a-part-of-the-user-experience\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usability represents kind of a technical UX component<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they are definitely not the same. Usability stands for things such as page loading time, interface\u2019s simplicity and so on. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, user experience represents feelings and thoughts that go through customers\u2019 minds while thinking about or buying some of your products or services. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not about measurable things that you can write down, but rather about things that you can\u2019t express that easily.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-known success strategy is \u201cmouth-to-mouth\u201d marketing which requires you to offer high quality. What would happen to your brand if you invested in marketing and UX? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People would realize the value that you\u2019re providing and after giving you a chance, they would happily spread a couple of good words about you and your brand. Still, this two-edged sword could easily hurt you as well. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just imagine you offer, for some reason, bad user experience. Immediately you will notice rumors and bad words, spreading faster than ever.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>User Experience Is More Than What Digital Marketing Currently Counts<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, we\u2019re all used to communicating between ourselves and communicating with product owners via, for example, social media and such platforms. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these cases, it\u2019s obvious that companies promoting themselves on social media have to work hard on improving user experience if they want to stay on the market. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One can easily notice here that staying on the market doesn\u2019t guarantee to be successful, it only means that you\u2019ve managed not getting ruled out by some of your competition. The real struggle is still ahead of you.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s very important keeping in mind that the user\u2019s experience will be created no matter what happens in the end. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the moment a person needs or wants something, through moments of finding out about a product via certain channels of promotions, all the way to finally buying a product, the consumer can thoroughly explain their overall experience. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is exactly what you need to think about while working on your user experience. Every moment matters and every aspect of your business has to be processed in a way that you\u2019re always thinking about UX.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>User Experience Uses Multiple Research Approaches<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people might end up thinking that anyone can work on improving user experience since in their minds it represents nothing more than building fast and simple applications. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is quite different since it actually means analyzing people\u2019s needs, desires and even behavior in order to provide a quality user experience. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UX designers are actually makers of the digital economy, who are able to provide solutions for revolutionizing user experience, underline the people behind a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/iedbarcelona.es\/en\/cursos-info\/master-in-interaction-design\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">current master\u2019s degree in interaction design<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Marketers Need User Experience<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s strong turbulence going on between acquiring conversions and optimizing the user experience. In order to turn visits into payouts, marketers often opt for the aggressive approach of offering their products. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, optimizing user experience is important in order to keep them on your site and getting them to take a look at what you have to offer. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from that, we\u2019d all want them to come back to our site again, right? Here, user experience works like a balance between you and your customer\u2019s needs.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to keep in mind that users\u2019 needs are what you have to focus on. That\u2019s why whenever users demand lower page loading time, you give it to them. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s the same with the currently most popular design template called minimalism. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users want everything to be simple and they don\u2019t want to spend more than 2 seconds on your landing page, in order to find out what your site is about. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those needs can easily represent the user\u2019s specifications for implementing and providing a quality user experience.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Visual Experience<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality content and quality products are definitely something you must have if you want to make it out there, but we can\u2019t ignore the fact that humans are visual beings. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be precise, this means that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/visual-stories\/10-simple-rules-of-visual-storytelling-4ee868498447\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">visual storytelling<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can and has easily replaced a few other digital marketing strategies.\u00a0 <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every business should consider focusing on providing great visual experience as this is something that every customer would like to feel.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>User Experience Drives Loyalty<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key things that everyone highlights while talking about the brand is the importance of loyal customers. Guess what\u2019s the easiest way to turn a customer into your loyal customer? Just provide great user experience and they will be coming back for more and that\u2019s how they end up being loyal to your brand.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Give User Experience Its Deserving Attention<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking into consideration various researches showing that users are almost always unhappy with their experience gained by visiting sites via different devices, it\u2019s quite obvious that investing in improving user experience can definitely pay off. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As long as your website is optimized for mobile and pc devices, loads fast, and allows the user to understand the website\u2019s purpose within a couple of seconds, you are good to go.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New levels of engagement, happening between users and products, make users excited and lures them to visit again and stay. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, improved user experience imposes itself as the most effective, affordable way to gain customers and obtain profit.<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Once upon a time, selling products was determined by
