As per Twitter, the motive behind this new initiative is to modify the way conversations generally happen on the platform; based on the actual behavior content and conduct of users of their tweets. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2018\/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter has shared on its blog<\/a> that one of the important issues they\u2019ve been working to address is what Twitterati might refer to as \u201c<em><strong>trolls<\/strong><\/em>.\u201d Some of the troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what Twitter is actually talking about the troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation on Twitter, particularly in communal areas like conversations and search. It violates Twitter policies and attracts distortion, confirmed by its CEO Jack Dorsey in March.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/IMG_20171018_064213.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-16496 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/IMG_20171018_064213-300x292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Twitter testing, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>the results have come out that less than 1% of accounts make up the majority of accounts reported for abuse content.<\/em><\/span> It\u2019s not just the content of individual tweets, but the way users behave more broadly on the platform. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The action of these accounts has a disproportionately large and negative impact on people\u2019s experience even being a small percentage on Twitter. <\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Biggest New Approach:<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform will be evaluating not only the content of individual tweets but how the way Twitterati behave on the platform. The algorithm will be using thousands of behavioral signals like filtering search, replies, and update recommendations. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Twitter algorithm believes that any Twitterati is trying to modify or distort the conversation and acting like a jerk; it will automatically push (lower) down the tweet at the bottom. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter will be able to improve the health of the conversations and experiences on Twitter by using new tools to address the conduct from ethical and behavioral perspective. It won\u2019t be even waiting for the users to report such abuse content or potential threats to them. It\u2019s a one step ahead action to create a user-friendly experience and maintain peace on the platform.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initiative is meant to get out ahead of problems that might normally result in an abuse report and spoils the user experience under the existing system. In testing, Twitter has said the changes led to an 8% drop in abuse reports on conversations (the discussions that happen in the replies to a tweet) and a 4% drop in abuse reports in the search. These drops, the company believes, indicate that something is working.<\/span>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behavior signals that could result in content getting demoted include: <\/span><\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">users who tweet at a large number of accounts they don\u2019t follow; <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the frequency a user has been blocked by people they interact with; <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if a user (Twitterati) has created many accounts using a single IP address; and <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if an account is closely related to accounts that have violated Twitter\u2019s terms of service.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes will be rolling out from this week with new behavior filters that will be optional; however will be turned on by \u201c<em><strong>Default<\/strong><\/em>\u201d. The users can see \u201c<em><strong>Show Everything<\/strong><\/em>\u201d toggle in search where any they can even turn the filter on and off.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No wonder, the changes are part of life. However, this is not the end of the game. Even a system like this or any new model; people will figure out how to game it, take advantage of it but the company will do everything to make the user experience valuable. <\/span>\r\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;\r\nSimilar &#8211; related social media updates:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/facebook-released-its-new-content-review-guidelines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook released its new content guideline.<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Twitter has announced a massive change in its content (tweet) policies with an attempt to improve the conversational health of the platform.
