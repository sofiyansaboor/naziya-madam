If still figuring out what is all about, it basically refers that <\/span><b><i>you market or target a specific generation of a people based on the preferences, attitudes, and upbringing; for your products or service. <\/i><\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It \u2018s really a great strategy to target your potential audience by understanding their age groups, preferences and activities. Understanding generation marketing helps you to switch your blind mass marketing strategies to tailoring as well as customizing for specific age groups. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you are a blogger who writes about party life and pubs around the cities. The age group of your targeting audience will be between 16 to 35 years who will be interested to know more about the party life than the people falling in the age group of above 35. Along with that, you will be targeting them on their behavior patterns like places with bars or roof side ambiance, etc. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By understanding the behavior and patterns of your audiences or customers, you will gain a competitive advantage because you will be meeting your audiences\u2019 needs and understanding their individual needs as well. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This potential audience or customer is your target audience who is interested to read about your blog or purchase the product or service you are offering; is ultimately referred as \u201c<\/span><b><i>Lead<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d in the digital marketing world.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Targeting the audience as per the generation marketing is a way to capture the same lead &#8211; meaning you club them to take the <\/span><b><i>first step &#8211; awareness- \u00a0in your marketing as well as sales cycle &#8211; i.e. <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/free-content-marketing-course-chapter-2-how-content-marketing-relates-to-marketing-funnel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing funnel<\/a>.<\/i><\/b>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Types of Generations in Generation Marketing<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the marketing world, the living generations have been divided up into the following 6 categories:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>GI Generation<\/strong> \u2013 Born between 1901 and 1926<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Silent Generation<\/strong> \u2013 Born between 1927 and 1945<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Baby Boomers<\/strong> &#8211; Born between 1946 to 1964<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Generation X<\/strong> &#8211; \u00a0Born between 1965 to 1976<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Millennial \/ Generation Y<\/strong> &#8211; Born between 1977 to 1995<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Generation Z<\/strong> &#8211; Born between or after 1996 <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for a digital marketer who is highly active on social media platforms, they divide generations into these following Generations. <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Baby Bloomers<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the part of the generation that falls or born between 1946 to 1964 that is most likely get avoided while making your marketing strategies, especially on social media.
