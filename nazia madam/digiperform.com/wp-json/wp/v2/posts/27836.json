Its benefits are plenty.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per stats, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social CRM increases <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer retention by as much as 26%, making it a necessity <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to incorporate your CRM strategy. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media, being a vital customer touch-point, is where customers talk about things that matter to them, their experiences, and their opinions on your business.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case a customer is unsatisfied with a product or service from you, they will immediately let their friends and family know about it through social channels.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, social <a href=\"https:\/\/salesblink.io\/customer-relationship-management-software\">customer relationship management software<\/a> is vital for making your business accessible to customers, keeping informed, and staying proactive in engaging with and getting to know your customers better.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five essential tips you can implement while building a social CRM strategy for your business:<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5>Identify Problems and Define a Goal.<\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like every other business strategy, your social CRM strategy will be successful only when you can identify problems and have a clearly defined goal. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the challenges your customers are facing? What are the things missing from their perspective? What can you do to have more relevant, convenient, and helpful conversations with your customers?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you can identify the problems your customers are facing, you will be able to set a clear goal. You want to know what your end goal is and work toward achieving it. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your goal(s), you can track the team\u2019s progress.<\/span><b><i> Is your goal to increase conversions?<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You need to check the website traffic metric, lead generation metric, conversion metric, and so on.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See that the end goal of your social CRM strategy incorporates what you wish the future environment of your business to be. While at it, you should also consider customer experience and profitability.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5>Use the right Social Tool and CRM.<\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incorporating a Social CRM strategy, your business needs to select the right social media analytics tool to manage the social media efforts.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform you opt for will become the hub for scheduling social posts across all the channels in which you are active, monitoring what people are talking about you and to how many people, and communicating with customers. Your Social CRM tool should be able to perform all of those things and integrate with the CRM tool you are using.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.sproutsocial.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360033472432-Premium-Analytics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sprout Social Premium<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a good tool with advanced analytics capabilities. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from that, your business needs a great CRM. Your social tool will look at how your marketing efforts are performing across your social platform engagements.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s crucial that your CRM allows you to integrate with a social media management tool you use. That said, it should be a CRM-specific social media tool. The crucial tools include a dashboard, reporting, and tools for gathering clean data.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many CRMs out there with easy-to-use, customer-centric social media tools embedded into them. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/products\/crm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HubSpot CRM<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/solutions\/essentials\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce Essentials<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are good examples.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5>Use relevant Social Channels<\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses try to be present everywhere their customers are. But it is the wrong approach. It is more realistic to target only the most relevant social networks when you are starting out.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out the channels that your customers use most frequently and opt for not more than two. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider starting with Facebook and Twitter.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As of the third quarter of 2019, monthly active\u00a0Facebook users\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/data\/facebook-statistics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.45 billion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making it the world&#8217;s largest social media platform.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as of the first quarter of 2019<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0had <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/282087\/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users\/#:~:text=How%20many%20people%20use%20Twitter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU).\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">330 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> monthly active\u00a0users.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Twitter has a format that allows for fast, brief, and user-friendly communication.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can still be active on other social channels, but you\u2019ll be investing a lot trying to turn each platform into a customer support center. What you can instead do is offer links to other avenues for customer support in your secondary accounts.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be a waste of time creating and posting content <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and engaging with followers on a social media channel that is not relevant to your business. If you own an e-commerce site, it will serve your business well to post eye-catching photos of your products on Instagram or Pinterest and engage you\u2019re your customers.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you are a software company, your audiences are more likely to be localized in the three traditional channels Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case your customers are inclining toward a new social channel, you can consider monitoring the channel. However, see that you don\u2019t take hours to respond to a Facebook query because you are busy managing your secondary Snapchat account.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5>Keep representatives to respond to Social Media queries fast or Automate Messages<\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media managers serve as real-time customer support representatives, and they are the ambassadors of your brand. Your reps should respond to customers\u2019 queries on social media quickly. A genuine interaction should take place during the conversation and not a transaction.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b><\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>If you look at the stats,<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per CrazyEgg,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.superoffice.com\/blog\/live-chat-statistics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">38%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of customers\u00a0are more likely to purchase from a company offering live chat support<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kayako\u00a0reports that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.superoffice.com\/blog\/live-chat-statistics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">79%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of businesses that implement live chat saw increased customer loyalty, sales, and revenue.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a survey, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/808477\/expected-response-time-for-social-media-questions-or-complaints\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of respondents said that the expected response time for social media queries or complaints is within 24 hours or less.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interacting with your customers, don\u2019t be afraid to give out your first name. Consider integrating your social network and customer service teams into an interconnected department to boost the speed and response quality. But that would depend on the type of business you have.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main challenge of offering customer support via social networks is that it demands you to have someone available to respond quickly. If not, you should have an automated message set up letting the customers know a rep will respond ASAP. Thus, ensure that you somehow manage to interact with your customers at any time of day.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also crucial to integrate your social media support with sales support via live chat, email, or a call center. Since not all queries can be answered or not all problems can be solved in a public forum, you require a more private system (sans a word count limit) to resolve the issue.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you solve the issue, you can always go back to the social media chat and thank the customer for their patience. It shows that you respect and value them.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h5>Use social incentives to increase brand loyalty<\/h5>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most vocal, loyal, and active followers on your social media accounts are assets. By building a relationship with them and those with significant social influence, you can turn your online presence into communities.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a hashtag campaign on Twitter around a specific promotion.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coca-Cola\u2019s #ShareACoke\u00a0is the most extensive and excellent campaign in digital marketing platforms.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/taggbox.com\/blog\/examples-of-successful-twitter-hashtag-campaigns\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign\u2019s aim was to call people to share a bottle of the drink with their loved ones. The company personalized the bottle for each entry, and it ended up generating huge sales for the brand. Besides, they were able to gain plenty of user-generated content.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<b><\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>If you intend to run a hashtag campaign, consider these tips:<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create hashtags that trigger the emotions of the people.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t use a hashtag only relating to your brand.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a unique hashtag that is not extensively in use.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make your hashtag short to allow people to memorize it. Avoid combining more than 3-4 words to come up with one hashtag and keep it less than 12 characters.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capitalize each word. It will avoid miss-spell when you club them together.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create your hashtags to align with your goals.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using your hashtags, build a\u00a0live Twitter feed for events.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also give a shoutout on Instagram to your most active followers within a week. Giving discount offers or promotional codes are great ways to repay engaged customers.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social networks offer you more instant access to a broader range of customers and using Social CRM, you can benefit more from those connections.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to do it is to run competitions. People love the competition and equally love getting prizes when they win. The thrill of competition is something that free prizes can\u2019t provide.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of opportunities for competitions. Plan it right, and you can get some free advertising.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, you can ask followers to submit videos, artwork, or other visual elements. You can use varying content and advertising after the competition ends. Just ensure that the prize compensates for the time the participants invest.<\/span>\r\n<b><\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Wrapping-Up<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that a social customer relationship management strategy involves a harmonized effort between your marketing, sales, and customer service departments to enhance engagement with customers and boost brand awareness. Social CRM<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn\u2019t limited to collecting data and increasing sales. It should create a two-way conversation that involves outbound messaging and inbound queries.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though every business has different social CRM strategies, most involve the execution of\u00a0social listening\u00a0and\u00a0social publishing\u00a0tools. Focus on social channels such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. It is not a requirement to build a strong presence on each platform. Be present where your customers are.<\/span>\r\n<h4>Author Bio:<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aanya Rachel is the Content Manager at<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gototheaddress.com\/coworking-space-vadodara\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Address coworking space in Vadodara<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Gujarat.
