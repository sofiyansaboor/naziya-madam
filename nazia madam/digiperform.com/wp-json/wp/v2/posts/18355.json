It\u2019s our obligation to keep you updated and provide the latest digital marketing news from time to time. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, this post is a synopsis of the latest online marketing news for this month where Facebook ruled above all platforms, as usual. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here we go!<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Update 1: Youtube gives users more ways to track how much longer they are watching videos<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube has rolled out a new feature where users can track how much time they do spend watching videos on the platform. Though this feature has already been declared by Facebook and its sister company Instagram one month ago, YouTube tracking update seems more relevant as users spend a lot of time watching videos on youtube than any other platforms.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-28-23-57-02-552-1.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18371 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-28-23-57-02-552-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"247\" height=\"439\" \/><\/a>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-28-23-57-14-297-1.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18372 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screenshot_2018-08-28-23-57-14-297-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"261\" height=\"464\" \/><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, YouTube Kids App declared a new way out for users to set the alarm or time alert, especially for kids to remind them to get away from the app. However, this time it\u2019s more specific or shall I say completely opposite to its last update. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This seems a very healthy initiative by the video sharing industry to let users know how much time they have spent on the app that aims to help people reduce the amount of time they spend looking at their phones and scrolling through their social media feeds.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, on the other hand, less time spent on a platform could mean fewer opportunities for advertisers to connect meaningfully with users and get noticed by them. They may need to have to adjust expectations. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the marketers and advertisers need to work hard to understand and know how much of an impact the time well well-spent movement will have on the ad economy. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These kinds of updates may offer comprehensive marketing tactics but may protect from malicious content.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Update 2: Facebook welcome its new CMO &#8211; Antonio Lucio<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook recently released news of appointing Antonio Lucio &#8211; the former HP (Hewlett-Packard) marketing lead as its new CMO.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antonio will assume his new role starting September 4, according to a Facebook post from the company\u2019s chief product officer, Chris Cox.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_18356\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18356\" style=\"width: 452px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Chris-Cox-Antonio-Lucio-800x600.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-18356\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Chris-Cox-Antonio-Lucio-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"452\" height=\"339\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-18356\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox with the company\u2019s new CMO, Antonio Lucio<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHe has an extraordinary reputation in the industry as a leader, a marketer, an operator and a wise, gracious and deeply principled human being,\u201d wrote Cox about Lucio. \u201cFrom all of our interactions with him, he is a force of nature, and we are lucky to have him.\u201d<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucio gave his 3 years at HP where he led the marketing organizations for Visa and PepsiCo and was part of the brand and marketing teams for Kraft Foods Group and Procter &amp; Gamble. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its a huge management change by Facebook as the company already under the clouds of grudges and been struggling hard to overcome a multitude of obstacles. The company is trying very hard to prove its platform safe from malicious content and bad reputation because of misusing user data. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best of luck Antonio Lucio for your new role!<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Update 3: Facebook bans ThisIsYourDigitalLife App used by 4M people<\/strong> <\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the company in good faith of misusing user data; Facebook has banned another app &#8211; <\/span><b>ThisIsYourDigitalLife<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; after it banned \u00a0Cambridge Analytica for the same reason. \u00a0As per Facebook, these apps were breaching out the data policy. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook says it is notifying those who shared information with the myPersonality app, which was most active before 2012. The company is notifying users who have shared their information to the myPersonality app but it won\u2019t be notifying Facebook friends of any users impacted by the same. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be an individual alert shared by the company because there is no evidence that the app users\u2019 friends lists (unlike the app used by Cambridge Analytica).<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The ongoing investigation is still on\u2026..<\/strong>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to banning the myPersonality app from the platform, Facebook has suspended more apps as part of its investigations. In May, it announced it had suspended 200 apps for the misuse of user data after auditing more than 1,000. Now, more than 400 apps have been suspended.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook has tried everything to be more transparent and justify its actions, sharing how it reviews content and process for removing posts and accounts from the platform. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the company is strictly following its words especially after taking down 32 Pages for coordinated inauthentic behavior in July. Recently the company announced this week that it had removed another 652 Pages, groups and accounts originating in Iran.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Update 4: Facebook has removed 5k ad targeting filters to keep the platform safe for users<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have mentioned earlier, Facebook is pretty serious to keep its platform safe for users. Recently, Facebook removed 5k ad targeting filters to keep advertisers away from discriminating ethnic and religious groups. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change prohibits advertisers to use filters for housing, employment or credit-related campaigns. This could keep ads for things like job postings, housing offers or credit applications from being displayed to specific ethnic or religious groups.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhile these [ad targeting] options have been used in legitimate ways to reach people interested in a certain product or service, we think minimizing the risk of abuse is more important. This includes limiting the ability for advertisers to exclude audiences that relate to attributes such as ethnicity or religion,\u201d Facebook writes on its news <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/keeping-advertising-safe-and-civil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this activity, Facebook will be launching a certification tool within its Ad Manager platform that will require US advertisers to certify in compliance with Facebook\u2019s non-discrimination policy. This is currently for US advertisers only who are interested in advertising housing, employment, and credit-related products. <\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Update 5: Facebook has rolled out a set of tools to help advertisers create mobile-video ads<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a good news for video content creators that Facebook has rolled a mobile-first video creation tools for advertisers optimized for mobile environments. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisers, as well as marketers, can use the tools to add motion to existing images as well as videos. This tool help will help to create videos from assets such as logos or photographs; mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/making-it-easier-to-build-mobile-first-video-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook&#8217;s blog<\/a>. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tools include:<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Video Creation Kit<\/strong> <\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turns existing images and text into mobile-optimized videos framed in 1:1 for feeds or 9:16 for stories on Facebook and Instagram. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four templates can be found under Publishing Tools on a brand\u2019s Facebook page. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The templates are made to: promote a product (6 seconds); sell multiple products (6 seconds); show product benefits (15 seconds) or drive product discovery (15 seconds).<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>Video Cropping Tool<\/strong>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It crops videos to Facebook\u2019s recommended aspect ratios of 1:1 and 4:5 for feed, 16:9 for in-stream and 9:16 for stories.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Animate Option<\/strong> <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It automatically creates a video from still images like a static ad or company assets like a logo or photographs. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users can choose the Animate option when boosting a post. They can then use the video as created or customize it as seen below.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2018-08-22-at-1.15.10-PM-800x360.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-18357 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2018-08-22-at-1.15.10-PM-800x360.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"709\" height=\"319\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us know if we have missed any update for this month, we would be happy to add in our list.
