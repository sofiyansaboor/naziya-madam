Have a look!\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Digiperform- Hi <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Tejas<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. First, welcome to our industry speak section, DigiTalks By Digiperform. It\u2019s a pleasure to have your interview. Our readers would like to know about you. We would like to know about both, professional and not-so-professional <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Tejas<\/span><span class=\"s1\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tejas-<\/strong> Hello, first I would like to thank team Digiperform for giving me this opportunity. You guys have an amazing presence in Digital Marketing Training among the people out there. It&#8217;s my pleasure to interact and share my expertise with you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since my school days, I have always loved languages. It is such a fascinating medium to convey what you feel, so easily, I felt. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Later, during my graduation, I tried my hand at writing content for some of my friends and I developed an inclination towards writing. That was the time content writing as a career option started brewing up in my mind.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That time, Digital Marketing was a comparatively new field. To be honest, I was confused but I was sure about not choosing IT as a career option. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was a big NO for me. I kept exploring for a while and then my interest drove me towards SEO and Content Marketing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to me, everything around us is content which we consume in the form that best suits us. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That being said, I chose a digital marketing career because we can arrange and put forward the content in front of the people, ethically, to help them make decisions.<\/span><\/p>\r\nThis made me feel through this career option, I could live my dream career and follow my passion for writing.\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Digiperform- You are currently working as an SEO and Content Manager at Convomax Digital. Generally, people hesitate to choose an SEO stream and work for the same. What made you choose SEO as your career?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tejas- <\/strong>For a couple of years after graduation, I tried my hand in other aspects of digital marketing \u2013 PPC, Social Media, etc. This is where generally most of the pursuers go and I too went with the flow to gain experience. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But, as I got to understand, my focus shifted towards SEO. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have always believed to work on things from bottom-up and strengthening the core first. As it happens SEO sits at a very basic level of any online business and serves as a foundation. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, I think <em>SEO as a gentle giant like an Elephant. It is slow, gradually growing day-by-day, needs a lot of patience, but once it&#8217;s mature enough it can dominate the landscape around<\/em>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Digiperform- Taking care of both SEO and Content is not that easy. Especially, when SEO keeps on fluctuating every day. Like, Google is famous for updating and creating new rules for organic results. How you keep yourself motivated for the same?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tejas- <\/strong>Indeed, SEO and Content is a real hustle. Keeping an eye out for any algorithm changes seems like a rather monotonous task. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In SEO, you do it right or be prepared to lose everything you have worked for, after that algorithm update where businesses have crashed in just one day. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My motivation comes from the fact that I would like to keep businesses unaffected by such algorithm changes and that is the beauty of it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Digiperform- It\u2019s said, \u201cContent is the kind of marketing\u201d. How much you agree with it? And, Why?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tejas- <\/strong>As I have said earlier, everything around us is content in a variety of forms which we consume in bits and pieces that is the most relevant to us. We normally use the content as a reference for the solution we need for a particular situation. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marketing is a way to craft that content in an organized way to aid us in finding the perfect solution to our needs. Thus, \u2018<em><strong>content is a kind of marketing<\/strong><\/em>\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Digiperform- How much SEO and Content are related to each other. Which one has bigger role to play as per your experience and why?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tejas- <\/strong>Content is the core of any marketing strategy. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s just say content is the essence of SEO and SEO is the essence of any digital marketing strategy. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">SEO and content can\u2019t be separated. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All the answers we need are found in the content and SEO is the means to help you find those answers in the quickest way possible. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thus, SEO and content both have an important role to play and they complement each other.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform- If someone is operating a startup and looking for various ways to rank first, what kind of SEO and content strategy you would offer him\/her to follow to deliver the best content and reach out to the maximum audience? Let\u2019s say, someone owns a club. What kind of strategies should be followed, as a digital marketer?<\/strong> <\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tejas- <\/strong>SEO proves to be one of the most fun and challenging aspect to make a startup successful. It is a lengthy process and needs time before it starts showing results. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To start with, <em><strong>keyword research<\/strong><\/em> would be the foremost important thing to carry out. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Any online business, new or established, will only work if you provide your prospects with answers they seek for. Keyword research will help you understand what exactly they want.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Further, all the elements of the on-page SEO should be optimized keeping in mind the keywords. These include page titles, meta-tags, etc.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As we proceed with the SEO process, the next thing to focus on is the technical aspects of a website that include the URL structure, internal linking, optimizing the website for individual page load time, the mobile-friendliness and the XML sitemap.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once this is done, one can move on to establishing and increasing the website authority. This is done by gaining backlinks from other sites and is also called off-page SEO.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These things work for every business in general. For a club, focusing on the long-tail keywords that the club going people might search for, the kind of content needed would be trendier and which will go well our generation and optimizing the website for Local search would be some of the specific aspects to focus on.<\/span><\/p>\r\nFor beginner&#8217;s, I would recommend reading- <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-seo-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Complete Free Beginner&#8217;s Guide to SEO Marketing<\/a>, written by me. It has all the necessary concepts to understand SEO and what kind of things you should follow to grow your business digitally.\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Digiperform- How much you believe that SEO is evolving in 2019? What are the three trends you would like to suggest to everyone?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Tejas- <\/strong>SEO is an ever-changing and evolving process. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the search algorithms constantly improving for search, firstly having structured data markup on the website would be advantageous since AI is becoming increasingly popular.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Secondly, optimizing the website for mobile pages would be a wise choice as most of the traffic to a website comes from mobile devices.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As we discussed earlier that the content is at the core of any marketing strategy, search audience is also evolving and becoming intelligent in terms of putting forward what they exactly need. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thus providing quick answers to user queries using a variety of content forms like infographics, images, etc.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Digiperform- As you are aware, Digiperform provides training to people who want to make a career in digital marketing which includes content marketing and SEO as well.
