It is important to know what type of resume to use in a specific situation.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h3 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">What is a resume?<\/h3><\/div><\/div><\/div>[\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, let\u2019s know what a resume is. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;<\/span><b>R\u00e9sum\u00e9<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; comes from the French word <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">r\u00e9sumer<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meaning &#8216;to summarize&#8217;. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a formal document created by a person which contains their background, skills, accomplishments, and even previous jobs. It is submitted to your employers for them to have a glimpse of your background and decide if you are qualified for the position. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h3 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">Types of resumes<\/h3><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let\u2019s discuss the types of resumes. There are different types of resumes to choose from, it is important to know which one to choose because it gives you a better chance of getting accepted. Moreover, it helps you provide the information your employers need. Here are three main types of resumes.\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">1. Chronological resume<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the most common type of resume and is considered the standard in most industries. A chronological resume focuses more on your work history. It is arranged in chronological order in which your most recent job is found at the top, followed by your previous ones below.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers generally prefer this type of resume because it contains all their needed information and is presented in a short and concise manner. It shows your job history and the progression of your career over time. It is most beneficial for job applicants with a structured work history and a clear career path. When using this type of resume, make sure you have no sizable work gaps.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">2. Functional resume<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A functional resume is also known as a skill-based resume. It mainly focuses on your relevant <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fingerprintforsuccess.com\/blog\/hard-skills-vs-soft-skills\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professional hard skills and soft skills<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rather than your work history. The \u201crelevant skills\u201d section takes up the majority of your resume.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are changing jobs but don&#8217;t know how to make your past position relevant to your new job, then this type of resume might be for you. This can also be advantageous when you have sizable gaps in your work history. Since this resume focuses more on the skills, it can also be useful to fresh graduates with no experience.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">3. Combination resume<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A combination resume is a hybrid resume that combines a reverse-chronological resume and a functional resume. It allows you to highlight both your professional skills and work experience since it focuses on both your skills and work history. There are two main advantages to a combination resume, it allows you to present a quick overview of your work history, and helps your employer know your skills and qualifications.\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">When to use a combination resume?<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people prefer the two traditional resume formats mentioned above because it is straightforward and easy to make. A combination resume is very situational so you should use it when you:<\/span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are changing careers<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have sizable employment gaps in your work history<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And has a diverse range of skills and experiences.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;]<div  class=\"pix-heading-el text-left \"><div><div class=\"slide-in-container\"><h2 class=\"text-body-default font-weight-bold heading-text el-title_custom_color mb-12\" style=\"\" data-anim-type=\"\" data-anim-delay=\"0\">Conclusion<\/h2><\/div><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing which type of resume to use depends on your situation. To get a better chance of getting accepted, make sure you also do your research on the different resume templates and decide which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.resumenerd.com\/resume-templates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resume template<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is right for you.
