The entire team of All Stars Digital is thrilled and grateful. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with my professional life first, by the way, I&#8217;ve got a lot to say, so just loosen up and grab coffee\u2026. \ud83d\ude00<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately after I completed my Computer engineering from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai, I worked at Viacom18\u2019s Voot in their brand management sector. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the time, everything was about branding, from the basic color-scheme, logo placement understanding to Brand Reputation and Visibility which intrigued me. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like marketing and more specifically Brand Management is my calling. That is when I decided to pursue my further studies in this line. I managed to receive an admit from New York University &#8211; School of Professional Studies for Masters in Integrated Marketing. Lucky Me \ud83d\ude42<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the very first day, I had concluded that I\u2019ll specialize in Brand Management, but not everything goes as per planned. It felt like my life had some other plans. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h4><em><strong>How did I start working?<\/strong><\/em><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first internship in the USA was at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorkminutemag.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b><i>New York Minute Magazine<\/i><\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, my role was to monitor and optimize the analytics using all Social Media platforms. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After which, I returned to India for my Summer break and worked at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.republicworld.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Republic TV <\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for 4 months. I contributed towards their digital launch and solely oversaw their youtube page, here I learned the importance of monetization of social media platforms. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of my past 3 experiences, I got my first job in the States. It started the moment I returned for my third semester. Tier One Advertising Agency (T1), I joined as a part-time Marketing Associate and after 6 months I was promoted to Operations Manager. Coordinating with all the clients, handling social media platforms, SEO (Website and App stores) were a few of my duties at T1. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was lucky to have had a chance of working directly with <\/span><b>Akon\u2019s team<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to launch his app <\/span><b>Emojikon<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and managing social media accounts of many models including a few <\/span><b>Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/emojikon.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-22400 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/emojikon.jpg\" alt=\"emojikon\" width=\"411\" height=\"411\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I simultaneously freelanced for a few other companies and learned as much as I can about <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/digital-marketing-guide-marketing-todays-digital-world\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Marketing<\/a>. My counselor at NYU was pleased with my work experience and said that I have earned extra credits and I qualify for a double specialization. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I graduated with a Master\u2019s degree and a double specialization in Brand Management and Digital Marketing. After working at T1 for more than a year, my father Mr. Nagesh Chhabria recommended considering starting my own agency back in India. It was a great idea. Why not use my expertise in my own country. And, it clicked!<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the support of my family I founded my agency, after interviewing more than 100 people, my ideal team was hired and now we proudly call ourselves <\/span><b>All Stars Digital<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span>\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>My Hobbies<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">:<\/span> <\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love traveling, I have visited 4\/7 continents.

I strongly believe that any influencer on Instagram with just a thousand followers; or a mega Bollywood star followed by millions have the power to influence an audience into buying any product\/service. <\/span>\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The catch is it needs the right push. And that\u2019s where we come into the picture! <\/span><\/i>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, I decided that we won\u2019t just restrain to only influencer marketing but use every digital marketing service to influence the audience with their purchase decisions. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All Stars Digital is the shine that adds sparks &amp; shimmer needed to generate buzz, attract and convert the audience from being a mere follower to a consumer, using everything the digital space has to offer.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/allstarsdigital.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-22401 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/ASD-Logo.png\" alt=\"all stars digital\" width=\"370\" height=\"188\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h4><b>Digiperform<\/b><b> &#8211; You have shared the profiles of your team on your website.

Though, some have discontinued working with us because they had to explore other opportunities, and I completely understand that. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of them started his own company and returned as a client but all the others who stayed have been loyal and constantly working hard to achieve our goals. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can say, I have been lucky to have a great team whether they have stayed with me or not. \ud83d\ude00<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are a proud team, filled with millennials all wanting the same thing I do, find some quirk and show it in our work.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-22397 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Team.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"591\" height=\"669\" \/><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They all are working here because at the end of the day, everyone has to contribute with campaign ideas for each of the clients, whether they are in the Social media team, Marketing team, Search engine marketing, design team or are solely invested in content writing. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each person at All Stars Digital wants to test their creative side and contribute and make our brands shine. With all the running around and the constant pressure to think out of the box, not all days are happy and easy. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s where Euro comes in the picture, our company\u2019s mascot.

More than doing it\u2019s like monitoring, encouraging others to do it. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, most part of my day goes in monitoring everyone\u2019s work, building a rapport with every team member, trying my best to help them implement what I imagine. Phewww!<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At times, they provide exactly what I am looking for and the rest of the times, they surpass my imagination. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an entrepreneur I have learned, I have to do a little of everything, from balancing between finance to surveying new hires like an HR, from monitoring all content to contributing with campaigns, and primarily dealing with people be it my team members or clients. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have been lucky to have clients from different genres, our campaign meetings are undoubtedly the time we all look most forward to. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brainstorming ideas, listening to some really good concepts and understanding how different people with different backgrounds can come up with strategies to promote the same product is the best part of what I do. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is when I feel like a marketer. I think, that 1 of my best decisions has been making it a compulsion for everyone to contribute to campaigns. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been blessed with opportunities in a way that I have had some experience in every field of digital marketing, in the start it was helpful for me and now I am in a position to share it with my friends, team members, and clients. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Till today people don\u2019t understand which service of digital marketing is going to help them better reach their goals. Consulting people on how they should allocate their funds, and why a particular service fits best for them has been a norm of my entrepreneurial life. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consulting also includes a lot of strategies developing. We came across a client who hired us for 3 months only to consult her, give her strategies a direction, suggest her ways on how to grow and later she signed us for the implementation. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think of myself as a marketer, wearing entrepreneurial shoes and paving the path as a consultant, always on the lookout to fill potholes with the rocks of progression. <\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>Digiperform<\/b><b>&#8211; What makes All Stars Digital &#8211; the Best Digital Marketing Agency in Mumbai?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<b>Riddhi: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are an agency that looks at everything differently, gives solutions differently and makes marketing easier &#8211; Differently!<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are an agency that provides quick and quirky digital marketing solutions that help brands shine.

But every employee has the same vigor and vision that I have. Be the one-stop solution for everything digital. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the digital space changing every nanosecond, it is difficult for brands to keep up with the digital hemisphere. We make sure that\u2019s checked off for our brands. We are available, ready and game to anything digital.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This industry brings along a fair amount of challenges but it somehow drives all of us. We work for our brands and that\u2019s why we work even harder when they bring different challenges on our plate.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>Digiperform<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; <\/span><b>How do you see digital marketing evolving in the future? What are the top three trends do you foresee for the coming year 2019?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<b>Riddhi: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of theories when it comes to the future of social media but in our opinion,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The landscape is dynamic and unpredictable. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is that social media is constantly evolving, which is what makes it a very exciting field to work in.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is an industry that constantly keeps you on your toes and forces you to be creative. This helps us grow as individuals making us nurture our creative spark as well as move with the fast-growing, changing trends. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This industry cannot be confined to one part of the spectrum and is going to constantly evolve and grow.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Three Trends for the year 2019<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competition is fierce and consumers are unpredictable, which makes you brainstorm new marketing ways to persuade people to buy your products and services. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are different methods such as engaging web content, PPC campaigns, blogs, social media and videos still common and popular among entrepreneurs, but these sources are not enough if you want to create competition in the market. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology trends are evolving as fast as anything and therefore you have to stay abreast of them. There are many digital marketing trends that will drastically change your digital business in 2019.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Voice search for higher CTR<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to experts, 3 billion searches made on Google every day are voice searches. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri have recently been introduced that identify human speech and answer queries. When you type a query in the search bar, you get lots of search results and therefore chances are the customer will lose sight of your website. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when a customer uses a natural-language user interface, for instance, Siri, it\u2019ll give you a few results and therefore your CTR can be much higher if your website is amongst those results. So make your search phrases more conversational.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Chatbot for personalized customer services<\/b><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication with customers is now easier with chatbot while keeping a lid on your budget. It can be integrated with a website, social media and an application, and interactive agents can receive queries and give data related answers. You can use user queries and information to make a further customized marketing strategy.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Video marketing to grab more audience<\/b><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are expected to continue to rise because the majority of customers watch videos than reading blogs. If you want to draw the attention of your customers to your new launch, make an engaging video detailing about the product and spread it on all social media platforms including your website. Find the best way to incorporate video marketing into your strategy.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span style=\"color: #993300;\"><b>Programmatic Advertising<\/b><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programmatic advertising involves the use of automation technology to buy and sell digital media. Its benefits far outweigh traditional advertising benefits. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The automation can help you buy advertising space more efficiently and target advertisers\u2019 most valuable customers. You can access any amount of your audience, analyze data and get a real picture of how effective your ad is, which will further help you develop a more effective ad campaign.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><b>Digiperform<\/b><b>&#8211; What are your future plans? <\/b><\/h4>\r\n<b>Riddhi: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are looking to have 4 branches in different cities of India by 2020 and expand internationally by 2025. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, we cater to only digital marketing needs but by 2020 we want to be a 1 stop shop for all marketing.
