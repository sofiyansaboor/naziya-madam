Follow These 5 Steps"},"content":{"rendered":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing an effective marketing proposal can be challenging. As marketing results are rather difficult to track, it can be complicated to determine the true return on investment of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/5-most-effective-digital-marketing-channels-for-your-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any marketing approach<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A marketing proposal (digital and traditional) allows you to demonstrate to a prospect precisely how you intend to implement a strategy while taking into account all of these aspects.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to know what you have to come up with a great proposal, follow the steps listed below.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Do your homework and learn more about your client<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your ideal customers need to be positioned front and center in a marketing proposal. This entails conducting research on the company or organization that the client owns or operates, determining the client&#8217;s issues and marketing requirements, and gaining an awareness of the client&#8217;s rivals.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time spent researching will be worth it in the end because it will result in a more thorough proposal.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep an eye out for what is known as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/uncover-business-pain\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pain points<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the marketing industry. A pain point is a problem with the client&#8217;s marketing plan that needs to be corrected. However, the client is either unaware that there is a problem or doesn\u2019t know how to fix it.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A poorly targeted advertising campaign or an inadequately monitored <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/7761-facebook-business-guide.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are two examples of potential pain points.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early research should be conducted to locate these issues and then surprise the customer by describing the problem as well as the solution before the client even asks for it.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional information can be obtained by having a conversation with the customer about the project and trying to get a sense of where they are experiencing difficulty. During your conversations with the client, topics such as the amount of money they are willing to spend and the time period should be discussed.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><strong>Write an outline<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you&#8217;ve done your research and made a plan of action, do a basic sketch or framework that you can use to present all of your information in the best way possible.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why templates are so important for making quick and clear proposals. As with many business documents, marketing proposals will have a standard set of information about your business as well as the goods and services you offer.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For each business type, you can write a good proposal. If you\u2019re struggling with this step, it would make sense to take a look at various <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.proposify.com\/proposal-templates\/digital-marketing-proposal-template\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital marketing proposal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> templates and make the process even smoother.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Templates make it easy and quick to speed up this task, which can turn something that used to take days into something that can be done in minutes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you&#8217;ve done your research, you&#8217;ll need to tailor your service offering to meet the business needs of your customer.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><strong>Craft an action strategy<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After putting together everything you&#8217;ve learned, you&#8217;ll make a plan for the client. This plan will be the basis of your proposal and it will help you figure out how to make your outline.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use action plans to figure out how to talk to project stakeholders, what tools you can use to deal with their unresolved issues, and how you can help them solve their pain points while helping them reach their goals.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the &#8220;sales plan&#8221; part of the proposal. Each problem on this list should have a problem statement and a possible solution based on customer conversations. For example, if the client&#8217;s social media advertising doesn&#8217;t use targeted keywords, this is the problem.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure out how much time each suggested solution will take. The timetable for the proposal will be based on this and this is where you will figure out how long it will take your team to finish their part of the job.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><strong>Sit down and write<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You now have all the important elements that you need to craft a great marketing proposal.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you start writing your proposal, keep in mind that you need these essential parts included in the proposal:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive summary;<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover page;<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timeline;<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing;<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Action plan.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><strong>Bonus tip: Make a memorable cover page<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your proposal&#8217;s cover page should serve as an aesthetically pleasing introduction to the rest of the document. If you\u2019re putting together a proposal for a client, the cover should prominently include the client&#8217;s company name and logo.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal should immediately make clear that the focus is on the organization and vision for the project. As you will be handing this over to stakeholders and decision-makers, you should make sure that the cover page is both aesthetically pleasing and eye-catching.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><strong>Final words<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal is your entry into the client&#8217;s business. As a result, it should look as professional as the rest of your customer-facing materials. So, make it count!<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Writing an effective marketing proposal can be challenging.
