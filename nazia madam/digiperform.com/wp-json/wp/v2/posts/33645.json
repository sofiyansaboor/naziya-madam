Without investing in SEO, you can\u2019t expect long-term results. But SEO takes time &#8212; sometimes three months, sometimes a little more than that, and some industries even require a year-long investment to rank on Google.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For someone looking for instant results, or boost visibility in a competitive niche when top results are dominated by high-authority sites, PPC is the best option. In exchange for a few bucks, you can acquire the top spot on Google.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounds easy? It isn\u2019t! Running successful PPC campaigns is science itself, you have to research, experiment, and set new campaigns based on the data gathered from previous campaigns to create optimized PPC ads for your business.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the free tools you can use to nail your PPC ads is Google Alerts. In this article, I\u2019m going to show you how!<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is Google Alerts?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it\u2019s a notification tool that lets you track when people use certain keywords or keyphrases online. This knowledge ultimately helps you to optimize the existing campaigns and fill in the gaps.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me demonstrate its use with the help of an example.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong><i>Say you\u2019re selling chocolates online. You run separate PPC campaigns for each of the chocolates in your stock, such as Mars, Snickers, Cadbury, etc. You can set alerts for certain events, for example whenever someone mentions your company\u2019s name, or the chocolates you\u2019re selling, or post similar content, etc. you get a notification.<\/i><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that Google only sends you alerts whenever new content is published; you get no notifications about the content that\u2019s already published. And it\u2019s reported that Google doesn\u2019t send you every page that is indexed on Google.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To use Google Alerts, you must be aware of the operators used to set alerts for specific queries.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How to Set Up Google Alerts?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting up Google Alerts barely takes a minute or two. However, in your very first attempt, it might take a bit of time and thinking to set up your first alert.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the step-by-step process:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to google.com\/alerts and sign up, or sign in if you already have a Google account.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure it\u2019s the same account where you want to receive alerts.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will see a top bar with a search option, enter the query or phrase for which you want to be notified.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have entered the query, you will see several options below it regarding the region, language, frequency of query, sources, and the place where you want to be notified about it.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as the frequency of alerts is concerned, you can receive an alert instantly when the research is made, or once in a week or month.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By choosing a particular company, you can limit the alerts &#8212; that means you will only get an alert when a certain phrase is searched in your target region.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve never used Google Alerts before, I suggest you check out a couple of video demonstrations on YouTube.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How does it Help in PPC?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, so now you know what Google Alerts are and how you can set up alerts yourself. It\u2019s time to walk you through how this tool can amplify your PPC efforts and bring the best results.<\/span><b><\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Use Google Alerts to Find Trending Topics<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re not sure which keywords and topics should you target in your campaigns, Google Alert brings a myriad of ideas. In fact, you can begin your content ideas research from here by setting up alerts against keywords relevant to your industry.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every new alert will give you potential phrases and words to use in your next PPC ad copy. You will also discover the strengths of your competitors, the vacuum in your industry, and ultimately improve the results of your ads.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Spy on Your Competitors<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manual competitor research demands an abundance of time and focus. You can\u2019t find the loopholes in your competitor\u2019s ad if you don\u2019t analyze every element from ad copy to the visuals used. Besides that, every day you have to Google relevant queries to see the results.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Alerts makes this quite straightforward. Just set up an alert with your competitor\u2019s website mentioned in the alert against certain keywords and get alerts whenever a change is made to their ad.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Dig Valuable Data &amp; Use it to Improve<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running successful PPC campaigns is all about experimenting and tracking what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. If you\u2019re not getting results, this could be due to a weak ad copy, targeting the wrong audience, or showing your ads at the wrong time.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Alerts bring insights regarding your audience. And this data helps you to evaluate your performance and see if months of PPC expenditures have done any good to your online reputation. Do people know you in your industry or not?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can receive alerts if someone types your brand\u2019s name or your product on Google. This way, you will get plenty of information related to demographics, the type of audience mentioning you or search you on Google, and the frequency of those mentions.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><b>Summary<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the leading <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalgravity.ae\/services\/digital-marketing\/pay-per-click\/\"><b>PPC Services in Dubai<\/b><\/a><b>, <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we know the kind of boost well-optimized PPC campaigns can provide to your business.
