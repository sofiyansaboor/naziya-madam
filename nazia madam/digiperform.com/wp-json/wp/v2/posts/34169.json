There are developers and designers working together to make sure they reach final results according to the needs and ideas of their clients. However, there can be a lot of confusion and some misunderstandings, unless there\u2019s a killer web design brief.\r\n\r\nA web design brief is created with the aim to communicate the needs of the client to the development team and make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page. It needs to be detailed, goal-oriented, and communicate the right message to everyone involved. This is why we\u2019ve put together a guide with 6 essential steps for writing a winning web design brief.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s break it down together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Your Business Overview<b>\r\n<\/b><\/h3>\r\nYour web developers need to be familiar with the type of business you\u2019re running, to better understand your needs. This is why every web design brief should start with a business overview.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what you should clarify:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>the type of business you have<\/li>\r\n \t<li>the industry you\u2019re in<\/li>\r\n \t<li>what sort of website do you need<\/li>\r\n \t<li>who are your biggest competitors<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you are an existing business that already has a website, you need to write about that as well:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>your current website situation<\/li>\r\n \t<li>how your customers find and use it<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nCover as many details as possible to give the developing team a detailed image of what your current business situation is.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Describe Your Customers &amp; Target Audience<\/h3>\r\nWhen the developers start working on your new website, your target audience becomes their target audience.\r\n\r\nThey need to be thinking about the people who will be using the website and design it with those people in mind. Therefore, describe your target audience in terms of:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>age<\/li>\r\n \t<li>sex<\/li>\r\n \t<li>location<\/li>\r\n \t<li>online behavior<\/li>\r\n \t<li>habits<\/li>\r\n \t<li>preferences<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nGive a detailed report about your customers and make sure you provide all the information you\u2019ve got on them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>The Goals of the Project<\/h3>\r\nNow it\u2019s time to set the goals that you\u2019d like the developing team to achieve with the project. That means you should explain what you want your new website to bring you.\r\n\r\nThere can be all types of goals, especially depending on whether you\u2019re creating a brand new website or fixing the old one. Here\u2019s what we have in mind:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>improve website performance<\/li>\r\n \t<li>add an e-commerce section<\/li>\r\n \t<li>create a new website to help potential customers find you and get informed<\/li>\r\n \t<li>generate more leads<\/li>\r\n \t<li>improve traffic<\/li>\r\n \t<li>improve your online presence<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nMake sure you know what\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210102184333\/https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2020\/02\/20\/13-website-design-principles-any-business-should-keep-in-mind\/?sh=405bb056dc8a\">web design principles<\/a>\u00a0you want to follow, and state them clearly in your web design brief to make sure there\u2019s no room for confusion or misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Specific Features &amp; Requirements<\/h3>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve set the ground with some basic information, it\u2019s time to dig a little deeper and get into more details in your web design brief.\r\n\r\nIf you have any specific technical requirements you\u2019d like your new website to have, make sure to write it down.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what you may want to cover:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>user logins, registration, and authorization<\/li>\r\n \t<li>products and services you\u2019re selling and offering<\/li>\r\n \t<li>product categories<\/li>\r\n \t<li>payment &amp; checkout methods<\/li>\r\n \t<li>site blog<\/li>\r\n \t<li>About us page<\/li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210102184333\/https:\/\/www.editingcorp.com\/optimize-your-workflow-with-portfolio-website\/\">portfolio<\/a>\u00a0page<\/li>\r\n \t<li>user profiles<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou can even describe each section, and make a list of features you want to see on the screen. You\u2019ll be helping the developing team understand your vision and try to find the best solution to make it happen.\r\n\r\nIn case you need any help with writing a web design brief, these\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210102184333\/https:\/\/bestwritingadvisor.com\/\">rewriting services<\/a>\u00a0can help you create a template and use it for all your future web design briefs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Project Timeline &amp; Deadline<\/h3>\r\nYou want to be sure that the team you hire to create your new website will be working round the clock to make it as efficient and professional as possible. This is why you have to set some deadlines and agree on the project timeline for everyone to follow.\r\n\r\nYou could divide the project into several phases and set a deadline for each of the phases. Those include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>agreeing on the project goals and starting the project<\/li>\r\n \t<li>sitemap creation<\/li>\r\n \t<li>creating the content<\/li>\r\n \t<li>adding the visual elements<\/li>\r\n \t<li>testing the website<\/li>\r\n \t<li>launching the website<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nSet a deadline for each of the phases to make sure you\u2019re keeping track of everything that the developers are doing with your website. This way you\u2019ll be sure they\u2019ll meet the final deadline and achieve all the goals you\u2019ve set.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>The Budget<\/h3>\r\nAnother important aspect you\u2019ll need to cover in your web design brief is the budget. You have to set a budget for the project and make it clear how much you\u2019re willing to spend.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget that the budget will influence the end result, so make sure you leave some room for negotiating.\r\n\r\nOther than that, make sure to cover:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>the total sum you\u2019ll be paying<\/li>\r\n \t<li>the payment dynamics<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThis way, you\u2019ll be showing you\u2019re professionalism and respect for the team you\u2019re hiring. Once they agree on the price and accept your offer, they\u2019ll be ready to start working on your new website.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Final Thoughts<\/h3>\r\nWriting a killer web design brief is a necessity for anyone looking to hire a team of professional web developers. The brief will give you the power to set goals, express your wishes, and tell them exactly what you want.\r\n\r\nUse the steps we\u2019ve covered above to write a brilliant web design brief and get the website you want for your business.\r\n\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]The process of developing a website is complex and oftentimes very demanding.
