Global revenue almost hit $200 billion in 2021 \u2013 similar to the GDP of a medium-sized country like Greece \u2013 and it is expected to keep growing across the 2020s. Beyond the current popularity of gaming in and of itself, there are many reasons to believe this growth can be sustained, not least the rise of virtual reality and the concept of the metaverse.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, while gaming is booming, it should be said that not every release can be a Fortnite or Minecraft. For instance, the Apple App Store currently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/268251\/number-of-apps-in-the-itunes-app-store-since-2008\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has over one million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gaming applications. It\u2019s a crowded market, and that means there are going to be winners and losers. Unfortunately, there\u2019s going to be more of the latter than the former.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-39545 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/unnamed-9-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Raid game \" width=\"505\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/unnamed-9-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/unnamed-9-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/unnamed-9-400x400.jpg 400w, https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/unnamed-9-75x75.jpg 75w, https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/unnamed-9-460x460.jpg 460w, https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/unnamed-9.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" \/><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are plenty of winners in this market. Consider the fortune of Josh Wardle, who created the simple Worlde game. He did it just for fun and created Wordle in a matter of days, and it soon became a viral global hit. Wardle <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/wordle-creator-explains-why-he-sold-to-the-new-york-times\/1100-6501982\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sold the rights<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the game to the New York Times for $1 million.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you have created a great game, how do you make it stand out ahead of the competition? It\u2019s not always easy, and to be honest, you\u2019ll need some good fortune. But there are certain rules to abide by, which can maximize exposure and at least give your game every chance of success.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>1. A Game is a Startup<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren\u2019t Ubisoft, Nintendo, Activision or one of the other big game developers, then you must treat your game like you would a startup business. In the development phase, that means asking yourself questions like, what need does this game fill? Is there a market for it? What type of person would play it?<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>2. Make Sure It Has a USP (Unique Selling Point)<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a game is a type of artistic expression, so the rules of having a unique selling point are broader than other products. Nevertheless, your game needs to have a clear identity, a hook for you to market to your audience.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>3. Social Media is Key<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The words \u201cgaming\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d go hand in hand these days. And it\u2019s not enough to hope that it builds organically. If you take a game like Raid: Shadow Legends, one of the world\u2019s most popular <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/plarium.com\/en\/games\/genre\/multiplayer-games\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiplayer games<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, its presence \u2013 both official and unofficial \u2013 is all over social media platforms like Twitter, Twitch and YouTube. Much of that is to do with the popularity of the game, but it\u2019s also due to the fact that its creators were able to instil a sense of community around the players.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>4. Get Technical<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have experience marketing a startup online, you\u2019ll know that SEO tactics are key to helping people find your product. Obviously, this can help with a game, too. However, there are some optimisation tactics unique to gaming. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, there is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/appradar.com\/academy\/what-is-app-store-optimization-aso\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the practice of AS0<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (App Store Optimisation). Similar in principle to SEO, it\u2019s all about getting more visibility for your title on the app stores. You may need to hire an expert to do this, but it could pay dividends.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>5. Influencer Reachout\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you agree with it or not, so-called influencers can be integral to the success of any product these days. And the gaming industry has very powerful influencers, many of whom ply their trade on Twitch and YouTube. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is that they will showcase your game to their followers, perhaps by playing a demo version or providing previews in a stream. As you might expect, those with millions of followers won\u2019t come cheap. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you can sponsor those streamers with 1000s of followers for relatively small fees, and that can get the ball rolling. While some might use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/how-to-use-affiliate-marketing-to-grow-your-small-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">affiliate marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, gaming has a unique relationship with influencers that might be more effective.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>6. Get Real About Pricing<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps one of the hardest things in this current climate is not getting people to play your game but rather getting people to pay for your game. You\u2019ll obviously value your product, but it\u2019s hard to convince people to pay for it. Many games offer basic free versions or follow the freemium model, where revenue is made through in-game purchases.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>7. Start Early<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of games start marketing before they are finished. Take the example of CD Projekt Red\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077, which was talked about for the best part of a decade before its release in December 2020. You can release screenshots of your game, little teasers that help create anticipation as you build your audience.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>8. Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Change<\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned, creating a game is an art form, and an artist can be reluctant to change their work. However, it is still a product, and you should, therefore, listen to feedback. Traditionally, changing a game (or something like a movie) after testing is viewed as a problem, but it needn\u2019t be a fundamental one. A few tweaks after getting some expert feedback might be all you need to send your game to the top.\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]It\u2019s common knowledge that the global gaming industry is booming.
