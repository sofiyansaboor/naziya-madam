Yes, you have heard it right. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find plenty of evidence that a degree is not necessarily proof of success in this era. The degree is nothing but the certified documentation that proves we have accomplished something potential in education. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these days people are more determined to enhance their skills instead of on paper documentation. This major factor has even encouraged top big companies to do something called <\/span><b>Skilled Based Hiring<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an alternative to hiring based on college degrees.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, higher education has always been a vital step to grasp real success and failing or dropping out of college in today\u2019s environment sounds like something out of a horror story. It\u2019s never an end story. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it would be better to continue college, to finish your degree with flying colors, and then continue on into a career of your choice, beginning your professional goals in the best possible way. But sometimes, due to unforeseen circumstances, that is not possible, and you may end up dropping out of school or college. And for some its choice of their life. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you fall out in the same case, the first and foremost thing that you have to do is: Do not give up and explore the right path for you. You need to be obdurate and fight for your future, for your success. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you need to make the right decision and look for options those don\u2019t stress for degrees. Being a college drop out, I understand the pain. In my early years of career, I also had a confusion related to my career like which career option could bring the best out of me, etc. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all research, I realized Digital Marketing is the only industry that doesn\u2019t judge you with your degrees. It solely emphasized your skills, knowledge, and passion to learn something new. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a keen interest in social media and deep love for the internet, then this can be the ideal as well as the promising career for you for the long run. In this post, I will share how digital marketing can be your shining silver armor in your dark career. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Digital Marketing? Where and how you can learn Digital Marketing? What can be your future prospects? And so on\u2026\u2026..let\u2019s read further.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>But first: Who are college dropouts? Why do students drop out?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A college dropout is a person who stops going to school or college, intentionally or out of circumstances when they were previously enrolled in.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, dropouts can be of three types:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one who want to follow some other dreams like Aishwarya Rai and Priyanka Chopra. These two beauties stopped pursuing their degrees as they had a keen interest in modeling and wanted to continue the same path. They could have studied but chose to pursue some other career. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second type of drop is the one who decides to discontinue college because can no longer benefit from the kind of education they are getting. This generally happens when one thinks that the qualities or subject they are looking for can be self-taught and they do not need college to teach them that. For example, both Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates started working on their companies while they were in college. Both were young enough to come back to school if their venture failed and born in privileged families, this allowed them the risk to fall and fail, though they didn\u2019t need it. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third type is someone who is forced to or somehow leave college due to unfortunate circumstances, like unavailability of money or personal problems or some, in the enthusiasm of following the trend. \u00a0This section includes Steve Jobs. Jobs faced the dilemma of choosing between discontinuing his education and impoverishing his parents. No points for guessing here, he chose the former.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><b>So, What is Digital Marketing? What is Digital Marketing Course? And Why Digital Marketing?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Marketing<\/a> is a form of marketing which is a combination of online practices and strategies that help businesses to promote and advertise the products or services through the internet medium. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a set of tools and marketing practices that help to build brand reputation and create awareness. In order to gain more online traffic and customer base, digital marketing is one comes short and reliable way to stand first in the online market.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the digital marketing industry continues to grow at a rapid pace and businesses are in need of skilled digital marketer to run their businesses smoothly; even marketers are faced with new challenges and opportunities within this digital age as well. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Marketing Course<\/a> is an initiative designed to educate students, marketers, entrepreneurs, and professors in the area of Digital Marketing to overcome the demand of skilled marketers.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning digital marketing is not rigid these days. However, learning through the right platform is all that matters. There are many ways and platforms to learn digital marketing. In the beginning, you can learn from YouTube videos or online available material, digital marketing books, etc. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, to learn the advanced level of digital marketing, one should always be encouraged to take offline or live sessions from reputed <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/trusted-institute-of-digital-education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Marketing Institutes or Training Companies<\/a> to learn digital marketing rather than just surfing the internet. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it really helps to gain more in person practical knowledge than online training. One should learn the digital marketing basics under professional supervision which can be led in learning the latest digital marketing techniques which are generally used by all the digital marketing companies or agencies.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>How to find the best digital marketing course\/training providers especially for college dropouts? <\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the few parameters that one should look after while looking for the best digital marketing training Institute for <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/significance-enrolling-digital-marketing-course\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Marketing Course<\/a>:<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Look for the Foundation, Objective and Achievements:<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foundation, objective and achievement play a big role to decide whether the training company or institute is worth enough to give your time, money and efforts; or not. Who has laid the foundation? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are their achievements until now? How many trainees have been trained so far? How long have they been in the industry? What are their objectives for their training? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they provide professional training? How many certifications do they provide? Do they provide extra classes when required? Do they provide placements and job assistance for getting the right job? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these questions can help you to decide what you have been looking for. It helps you to analyze how they have taken their role seriously. The digital marketing course you choose must have acknowledged as the Most Trusted Brand in the Digital Education rather than any enrolled one.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Course Duration and Training Management:<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A course batch generally depends on the student\u2019s availability which is directly proportional to course duration as well. The weekend\u2019s batches would ask for more weeks than weekday batches.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That means you can complete the same course within 2 months if you are taking weekdays batches as well as a short-term time investment rather than 4 months duration weekend course. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you can complete a digital marketing course in a month, but that won\u2019t help you in the long run if you have not attempted any practical sessions and campaigns while learning. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why every expert recommends learning on long duration courses so that you can learn every aspect of digital marketing through various practical sessions under expert supervision and clear your doubts as well.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the training, management is one of the major reason behind the successful learning. An ideal trainer or training management will always try that his\/her students will turn to out to be better than him\/her. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the course, flexibility, and duration would give nothing if the course\/institute is not blessed with the right trainer. <\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Job Assistance and Certifications:<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you complete your course, you need assistance to get the right role or job for your Digital Marketing Career. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should be the foremost responsibility of any digital marketing institute to provide full assistance to students in achieving the best placement possible. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There should be sessions for Interview Preparations, proper grooming sessions under expert supervision and 100% job assistance. Plus, you must be aware of how many certifications you will get after enrolling the digital marketing course. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The digital marketing Institutes should provide or help you to get at least these following certifications for your better Digital Marketing Career:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Adwords Certification<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Analytics Certification<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shopping Advertising Certification<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile Advertising Certification<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook Certification<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hubspot Academy Certification<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bing Certifications<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Institute Certification<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LaTX2FGFfEw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><b>Opportunities for College Dropouts:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<h4><b>Most Top- Highly Paid Jobs without any Degree: <\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand for knowledgeable and skilled digital marketers in the online space has been on a rise across the globe. Be it USA or Singapore, Dubai or Australia, digital space has the same kind of needs and jobs. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus this industry is not degree specific; its skill oriented. All you need to have knowledge about at least the basics and zeal to be experimental. Talking about our country &#8211; India, the skills gap due to digitalization have currently seen huge &#8211; a total of more than 180,000 jobs that with the same pace will be available in 2020, but with not enough professionals to fill each of these jobs. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore the demand is greater than the supply which in turn only increases everyone\u2019s chances of being hired at good packages.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>You can Choose Sector that Interests You: <\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital Marketing is a vast industry and there is a lot going on under the umbrella.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can prepare yourself for a multitude of roles in digital marketing for a wide variety of dispositions and skills. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like, you can try your hand to become content or email marketer, social media or mobile marketer, e-commerce executive, inbound marketer, an SEO or PPC executive or you can be an online PR expert. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is always great to have more to choose to make when it comes to your career.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Be a Freelancer: <\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A freelancer is a term generally used for a person who is the self-employed person who offers services to multiple businesses. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The type of work freelancers varies from person to person specialization such as social media marketing, content writer, copywriter, graphic designer and more. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a freelancer, you don\u2019t need to worry about working hours; you become an independent soul and can work for multiple clients at the same time which will add up your income for sure. You can pick your own brands and companies for the same.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Be your own Boss:<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the remarkable benefits of Digital Marketing is that you can be your own boss. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As everything is getting digital, you can start your own business independently and market or advertise it on your own as per the trend. As we already know, for starting a business you don\u2019t need to be a college pass out. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you need are the right marketing tactics and strategies. Digital Marketing is the future of marketing and learning it will make you feel more confident and one step ahead of all the other marketing strategies and tactics.<\/span>\r\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/k32z0JvtJU8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><b>A Real College Dropout Story:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, I have shared a real story of one of my known college dropout &#8211; friend and colleague &#8211; Pratik Chudasama, commonly known as Digital Pratik. While having a chit-chat with him, out of curiosity I asked him few questions on \u201cDid he regret not finishing his degree?\u201d Read out what he said in his own words. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-15197 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/pratik-300x283.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"307\" \/><\/b><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>About Digital Pratik:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He is a 28 years old dude from Gujarat (India), 3 times, proud drop out by choice from the final year of Engineering college &amp; a very proud owner of www.DigitalPratik.com + YouTube channel + various other online resources.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4><b>Why did you choose not to finish pursuing your college degree?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2007 I had scored 88% in Science in my 12th class and got into an Engineering college in 2007. During my college days, I was a brilliant student and used to excel with flying colors not until mid of 2009, my father got a paralysis stroke (currently in good health). <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sametime, I started disliking the communication subjects in my second half of Engineering. So, I decided to took a drop and got into the Sales Profession. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, in 2010, due to family pressures, I had to go to college once again and this time as well after a couple of months, but again a drop and joined sales again. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same pressure repeated, joined college and dropped again. This time I was also learning Digital Marketing on my own without letting my family know about it. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever I used to get a chance to connect my laptop to an internet connection anywhere, I used to immerse myself in learning Digital Marketing (Online Marketing or Internet Marketing). <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, in 2013, I decided not to go to college anymore. It was a tough decision indeed but worth it for me! <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, I decided to discontinue college because I was no longer benefit from the kind of education I was getting out of my interest. <\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4><b>How has that decision shaped your life and career?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally not having a college degree can present some roadblocks. You may miss out many opportunities to work with reputed companies or in a different country because a degree was one of the requirements for the work permit application. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, It can cause many awkward moments in social situations as well. But to avoid being judged, I used to jump at the opportunity to bring up my digital marketing career as I always had a keen interest in the same field. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, the decision was the best thing I could have done for myself. During my college years, random skills that I have acquired helped me to follow my own way of working and meeting positive people of the same industry. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helped me to work with amazing training companies doing a range of things from digital marketing to product development. I am no longer embarrassed and am even proud to admit I am a college dropout.<\/span>\r\n<h4><\/h4>\r\n<h4><b>What advice would you give to those who are not sure whether they want to attend or finish college?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would like to make it clear for everybody that I am in no way against to attend colleges and graduated through a traditional college education. I just believe to follow what your heart says. If you are not happy, then don\u2019t force yourself. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But degrees are also somewhere important. It provides a plain path and confidence to make your career. For some career paths, a degree is indispensable; for others, not so much anymore. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has drastically changed the world we live in and digital marketing is a complete valid example of this. Having a degree no longer gives you an automatic advantage or the same kind of security it used to be but as I have said earlier, the different industry has its own set of rules. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only advice I feel truly confident giving is: If you do decide not to pursue a college degree, you should never stop pursuing experiences, growth, and self-education as well.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><b>Key Takeaways:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always believe in your dream and once you are sure what are doing is what you want to do. <\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just Do it: If you believe in it<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figure out your passion<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in your skill building<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more and more<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be experimental<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build your own market<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Oprah, Steve Jobs, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates; these are few names which have one more something in common than Super Stardom: None of them have college degrees.
