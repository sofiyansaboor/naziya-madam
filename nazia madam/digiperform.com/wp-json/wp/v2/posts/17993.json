Some of your subscribers have opened it and others may not. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In such a scenario, you need to understand what are the considerable measures or actions you have taken in the email campaign that has officially worked for you. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, what\u2019s more, you can add to improvise the open rate as well as the conversion rate of your email campaigns? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For same, you need to apply A\/B testing theory that helps to experiment to create new effective marketing strategies. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is A\/B testing?<\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/B testing, \u00a0which is also called as Split Testing in marketing language, is a method that helps you to test human reaction on your marketing campaign. \u00a0It\u2019s a hypothesis about human behavior or reaction to your efforts. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The test can be based on many forms like testing the subject lines, formats, designs, content, call to actions, etc, of your email marketing campaigns. In an A\/B test, people are split at random into two groups.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>How does A\/B Testing Campaigns Work?<\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the test, two identical campaigns are presented among the two groups with minor changes such as color, designs, graphics, call to actions, etc. with the same agenda to target the audience. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original template is known as the <\/span><b>Control<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the other is <\/span><b>Variation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (what are you actually testing with changes).<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/ab-testing-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18000 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/ab-testing-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"229\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After creating templates, you compare the performance of the variation against the performance of the control. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The performance is generally calculated in the form of open rate, click rate, conversion rate, engagement, etc.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the variation is more successful than your original template (the control), \u00a0you get an idea of what works for your marketing strategy. Therefore you can replace the old control with the new variation and use it for further tests as well.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/variatinwins.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-17999 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/variatinwins.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"554\" height=\"311\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the variation does not perform better than the control, then stick with what you have and try a new test to improve your results from the control.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>What are the benefits of A\/B testing your email campaign?<\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An A\/B test has two main benefits:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It gives you data to back up what you think might be successful.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s probably the cheapest way you can improve your sales or conversions.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/B testing can be used on almost anything you can think of: your design, email copy (in the body or subject), calls to action, etc.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b>A\/B Testing Email Ideas To Improve Your Open Rates <\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subscribers open emails based on many reasons, like subject line, preview text appeal (especially on mobiles), sender, etc. You can A\/B test variations of each to find what works best with your recipients.<\/span>\r\n<h4><b>Idea 1: Send Your Email Campaigns At Different Times or Days <\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To discover what works best with your prospect&#8217;s schedule, consider A\/B testing:<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-12.50.05-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-18004 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2018-08-10-at-12.50.05-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"513\" height=\"396\" \/><\/a>\r\n<b>Day of the week:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While exploring email campaign by sending emails to thousands of subscribers, the study has found that messages sent during the weekend have higher open rates than weekdays. <\/span>\r\n<b>Time of day:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Time plays a very important role in open rates.

Getting this right message through the snippet can increase your open rates by up to 45%.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s roughly 40 to 90 characters to experiment with, depending on the email app or tool.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/preview.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18009 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/preview.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"434\" height=\"210\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h4><b>Idea 4: Use of Long vs Short Subject Lines in Your Email Campaign<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketers have always suggested using fewer characters in subject lines of your email marketing campaign.
