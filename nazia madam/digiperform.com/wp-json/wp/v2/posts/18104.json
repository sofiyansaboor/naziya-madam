And, there are 100 percent chances that your email might get ignored.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you think at the personal level, do you open and read every email? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you click on the links shared in emails? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you fill the forms and provide your details to each email response? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course not!<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s a reason it\u2019s become very important to understand the process of how to draw the attention of the recipients and urge them to convert as well. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this chapter, you will learn:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to get email conversions<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">practices to boost email conversion rate<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tips to increase sales and improvise your conversion rate<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18118 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/conversions-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"209\" \/><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email marketing is one of the incredible methods to nurture prospective buyers and generate sales even in this current competition. All you need to is think and show &#8211; What makes you different? What makes you best out of all? What kind of marketing strategy are you should follow for your business to generate leads and increase conversions? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email Marketing is an art to create a compelling and eye-catching marketing strategy. However, if it\u2019s designed in a right way, it can turn into the sale or the trash-can.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make sure your every campaign bring out the best conversion rate for your business, we are sharing few email marketing practices suggested by email marketers that can make email campaigns fantastic, effective and increase conversion rates: <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>A Captivating Title <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The title (subject line) is the primary thing anyone would notice and it&#8217;s reasonable the central factor regardless of whether you open an email or not. In order to increase your email marketing conversion rate, make sure your subject line that your email is all about. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you are sending a sales email to your subscribers, your email should incorporate &#8216;<\/span><b><i>20% Off on Next Order<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;. And, It will sound better than just stating \u2018<\/span><b><i>Discount on Next Order<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/purity_cart_abandon_5uhp5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-18113 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/purity_cart_abandon_5uhp5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"534\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subject line of the email marketing campaign should be appropriate (specific) and straightforward that gives more data.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the same subject line should be mentioned in your body of your email campaign. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider making it a bigger text style, striking or an alternate shading. But make sure it flows within your email\u2019s overall design; otherwise, you risk deterring prospective buyers.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>A Clear Call-to-Action <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One should never underestimate the role of <\/span><b><i>Call to Actions<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in any email marketing campaign. This is the only thing that will determine your open\/conversion rate and the success of your email campaign. Therefore, Call to Action should be clearly visible and must include well-stated directions on what to do. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, there should be less number of CTAs especially when it comes to redeeming any offer or sales discount. The same you might have noticed in e-commerce emails when they send their EOS (End of Season sale).<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-7.02.17-PM-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-18114 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-7.02.17-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"469\" height=\"621\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The big companies prefer to keep it simple and give only single or two CTAs to direct their readers on discounted landing pages. The longer and harder you make someone work for your offer the greater the chances are they will give up. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another of the most important thing you should keep in mind while creating effective email marketing campaigns- is the speed at which your landing page loads. The longer time a landing page takes to load, more it loses the interest. It&#8217;s a big turn off for readers\/visitors. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emails containing gifs or high-quality images on the emails slow downs the loading of the landing page. The loading should be fast and the design should be streamlined. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still not believe? then try this strategy with A\/B email testing. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create two emails with the same content with little variation in designs especially graphics. To learn A\/B strategy, you can read our chapter &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/free-courses-email-marketing-course-how-to-use-a-b-tests-to-improve-your-email-campaigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to use A\/B testing to improve your email campaign<\/a>? Try it, you will definitely get convince with our approach. <\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Targeted Emails and Segmented Lists<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a human psychology that they won\u2019t open an email if it&#8217;s not related to them. They won\u2019t be interested to open your email that won\u2019t interest them. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you keep on sending irrelevant emails, they will barely glance your efforts or may unsubscribe you as well. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This should not be happening! It will be like the pain in your marketing strategy. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, segment the list and target them as per your email strategy. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Segmenting your email list is not a difficult task to undertake and will greatly increase your click-through and conversion rates. One of the email marketing tools, Mailchimp have stated in their reports that segmented customers had a click-through rate that was 21% higher than normal. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s great and it makes sense! Personalization is important; it makes the reader feel special and also shows them you are not going to waste their time with unnecessary emails.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some ideas of ways to segment your list:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By engagement level. You could even send a \u201cre-engagement email\u201d out to any inactive members you currently have.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By persona, like gender or job title.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By location.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on shopping history.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider your readers, brainstorm with your team and start segmenting! We can guarantee you will see some immediate results in your conversion rates.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Great Copywriting<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality written content makes all the difference. That\u2019s why marketers say <\/span><b><i>\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/content-called-king-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content is King<\/a>!\u201d<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We have said it previously and we will presumably say it several more circumstances. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your emails should be engaging enough and clear about the product irrespective of whatever you have mentioned in the subject line of the email campaign. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your content should invoke an emotional response with your reader; make them laugh, make them care and most importantly, gain their trust! <\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use captivating headlines to catch their attention.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the content scannable by using bullets or breaking up large paragraphs of text.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write for your reader by using the correct language.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include keywords while keeping it natural.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include links that will directly land visitors\/readers to the webpage (destination).<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proofread for typos! This may sound self-evident, yet grammatical mistakes look awful. They ruin you and influence individuals to lose trust in your organization. So edit, edit again and after that ask another person on your group to edit it before you send it out. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Welcome Emails <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Welcome email is an extraordinary method to be in contact with new subscribers to thank them and express gratitude toward them for joining and let them recognize what&#8217;s in store. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly you need to tell them how frequently they will get an email from you. You may likewise consider sending them an appreciated activity or an offer particularly held for new supporters.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/target-welcome-email.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18115 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/target-welcome-email.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"455\" height=\"637\" \/><\/span><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the beginning of your relationship and this email is one of your initial introductions. Make them feel special and encourage them to engage with you. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is likewise an extraordinary chance to guide them to your online social media pages or your blog so that can start following you on other channels. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be that as it may, what&#8217;s the best part about the welcome email? It can be automated! The moment another supporter agrees to accept your mailing list they will get this email from you without you doing a thing (well, aside from creating the email, to begin with, and keeping it up to date, of course). <\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Reminder or Update Emails <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way to send the update email is to comprehend the purchasing cycle of your client. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did they purchase a membership for a service you offer? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the point when does it expire? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than giving their subscription a chance to run out and hoping that they decide to renew, send them an email. Maybe you could even include an incentive to sign up for a longer subscription. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make it simple for them to restore by incorporating a connection in your email where they can achieve it within a single click. The easier you can make this process the more likely they are to do it the minute they receive the email. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And guess what? These emails can be automated too; making it easier than ever to stay on top of your customer\u2019s buying cycle. All you need is to have a good email marketing tool to follow all these.<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/kate-spade1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18116 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/kate-spade1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"503\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Most Important Points:<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The most important to increase your email conversion rates:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run A\/B tests to see what your readers respond better with regards to content, layout, and design.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test your email in multiple browsers and platforms.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constantly monitor your click-through rates, open rates, and bounce rates to see what is the most popular.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the initial phase, these are the few practices that would definitely help you out to run a successful email campaign and generate more and more conversions. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include them in your email marketing strategy and let us know the results. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the next chapter of our free online email marketing course, we will be sharing the list of best email marketing tools. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay Tuned!<\/span>\r\n<a class=\"btn btn-default\" title=\"Read more\" href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/free-courses-email-marketing-course-how-to-generate-leads-with-your-email-marketing-campaign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Previous<\/a><a class=\"next\" title=\"next\" href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/free-courses-email-marketing-course-list-of-email-marketing-tools-to-optimize-your-email-marketing-campaigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Next<\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"In this chapter 7, we will be sharing what is email conversion and what are the best practices to increase the conversion rates of your email marketing campaign.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":36564,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[325,111],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Chapter 7- How to increase the conversion rate of your email marketing campaign?
