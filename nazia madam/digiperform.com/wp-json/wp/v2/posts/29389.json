Here we present you the 10 ways to get good customer feedback.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Live Chat with the Customer and Ask for Feedback<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin with, communication can help the company to understand the requirements of the customer, you get closer with them and better understand the issues that the customer has with the product. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also a popular marketing strategy to include \u2018live chat\u2019 in the Websites because with this feature, company can answer the questions of customers, customer satisfaction is enhanced, and potential feedback can be obtained. Furthermore, it urges your customer to keep coming back to the same company.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h3>Keep Calling your Customer Regularly<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Detailed and personalized feedback can be achieved by calling the customer. This method gives you the most valued feedback. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person calling should reveal his core interest in the customer\u2019s opinion about services the company delivered rather than just carrying out a formality, it will strengthen your company\u2019s relationship with the customer. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call time must be appropriate, according to studies, people feel comfortable responding between 4 pm &#8211; 6 pm and 8 am &#8211; 9 am, lunchtime is the worse.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Feedback via Email and Messaging Helpdesk<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to communicating via live chats, provide support through emails and messages and try having customer feedback. Any information obtained from emails or messages can be considered feedback. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is quite the same idea as above but here you approach the customer via email and messaging and ask for their feedback. Many users, approximately 29 per cent of them do not like live chat and feel comfortable with the emails as it offers picture attachments and detailed messages.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Feedback when order is placed<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feedback asked when the customer has confirmed his order is the best to know for his shopping experience. Ask them if they found their desired item? <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they had difficulty in website navigation? Are they satisfied with the options related to product purchase? Ask them if the website can be improved further and how was the overall experience they had?<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Give Freebies in return for Feedback<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, customers are not motivated for giving feedback. So, you need to motivate them. For that, it is good to make the feedback collection a fun activity by offering them small gifts in return for their opinion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give them discount coupons for shopping, promo codes of newly launched products, cards, samples. And this practice will fill out your message box to bottleneck. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also host a walk-in event at your store all you need is a counter, a marker, a poster to write on, some freebies and you are all good to go.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Post a Survey on social media<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer feedback can be collected by posting a survey on social media platforms. You create a survey link about your company and post it on Facebook status, Instagram stories, tweets, and blog posts.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is a very strong place for collecting feedbacks as the media visibility is vast, you only need to trigger the targeted audience, timely posts, and short surveys with closed-end questions do the best. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example:\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bavariafirefighting.com\/English\/Company\/Overview\"><b>best firefighting company<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Egypt.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abc company<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xyz company<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequently monitor your social media using tools or in-house staff and compare the social presence of your company and your competitors.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Use Polls to get Feedback<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, creating polls on social media and your website is the easiest and very useful way of collecting customer feedback. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get a massive response as poles are not a hassle and only one click can do more due to the user-friendly nature of polls. Polling helps make business decisions for a company as they allow you to get knowledge of the market trends<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Publish Positive Feedback<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most customers are hesitant in posting publicly so you can motivate them by publishing others feedback and make them feel for their effort will never get wasted. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also makes them feel of their valuable response. Publish genuine responses with the customer\u2019s full name, location, and organization if any because many people can differentiate a false and genuine review.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Deal with Criticism Professionally<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both positive and negative Feedbacks are equally important to respond and improve the company\u2019s performance. Every company faces criticism even the best hospital, the best shopping mart, and the <\/span><b>best firefighting company<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in town.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What matters the more is your way of handling the critics, so whenever facing this situation utilize your problem-solving abilities, at first apologize and respond humbly then bring them to the private channel of communication and remove the interaction from the public channel as the negative comments are most likely to get viral.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Ask for Ratings<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask your customer to rate your services on a scale of 1-5 or 1-10 this will reveal their satisfaction with their expectations, in the long term this rating will give you insights about your customer service and valuable business and market trends. When the rating is low prompt a few questions about how to improve the targeted area.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, customer feedback is crucial to your business especially to startups according to stats more than 70% of the people visit those brands frequently who aim to collect feedback. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As both positive and negative inputs from the customer are equally important, your primary aim should be to go the extra mile to satisfy your customer and improve your customer service performance. I hope, the above methods will help you achieve this aim.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us know in the comments, which method will you choose to collect feedback from your customers?<\/span><\/i>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]Customer feedback helps to analyse a service provider or a company of its performance, product quality, and credibility.
