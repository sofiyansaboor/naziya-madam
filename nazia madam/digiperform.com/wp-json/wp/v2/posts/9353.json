The brand generally makes use of content for attracting and nurturing high-quality leads across different markets. The main challenge before the brand was to generate leads from two niche audiences that would not respond to the same types of content. However, for achieving its goals, Kinvey turned to LinkedIn Sponsored Content that helped the brand reach their specific audiences with the help of engaging content to generate quality leads.\r\n<h3><strong>Kinvey\u2019s objective behind using LinkedIn Sponsored Content<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nKinvey was hunting for a new source of high-quality leads that could fill its <a href=\"https:\/\/zopto.com\/blog\/sales-pipeline-management\/\">sales funnel<\/a> however the two key audiences it had, mobile-focused enterprise IT specialists and businesses that would quickly deploy mobile apps, were not easy to be found. On top of it, both the niche audiences had different taste for content and most likely would not have responded to same types of content. So, the brand needed to target their eBooks, guides, and presentations in such a way that the right prospects see the right content.\r\n<h3><strong>Kinvey\u2019s strategy for using LinkedIn Sponsored Content<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nKinvey made effective use of LinkedIn Sponsored Content that is celebrated for offering unique targeting capabilities and could easily reach its niche audiences with the right messages. Moreover, the brand could also drive qualified traffic into its lead nurture program by maximizing the reach of its eBooks and other materials as Sponsored Content appears in LinkedIn feeds across desktop, tablet and smartphone.\r\n\u201cWe strive to create content that\u2019s useful to businesses involved in mobile app development, and we want to bring that content directly to the people who will benefit most from it,\u201d says Lauren Pedigo, digital marketing manager at Kinvey. \u201cLinkedIn Sponsored Content is a natural fit for us because members are looking to expand their knowledge base\u2014and because we could provide each of our target audiences with the content that addresses their unique business needs.\u201d\r\n<h3><strong>Accelerating the lead generation @ a lower cost<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThe powerful LinkedIn targeting capabilities along with delivering the content directly into LinkedIn members\u2019 feeds helped Kinvey generate 38% more leads at a 65% lower cost per lead in comparison to other social channels.\r\n\u201cWe slowly tested and grew our investment each month, and the results speak for themselves,\u201d says Pedigo.\r\n<strong><em>Campaign Highlights:<\/em><\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>38% more leads than other social channels<\/li>\r\n \t<li>65% lower cost per lead than other social Channels<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><strong>How to generate leads using LinkedIn Sponsored Content: <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Suggestions by Lauren Pedigo, Digital Marketing Manager at Kinvey<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<h4><strong>Suggestion#1: Understand your goals!<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<blockquote><em>\u201cDecide what action you value as a conversion,\u201d Pedigo says. \u201cIn our case, it\u2019s a content offer sign up. We focus on that specific action and aim to maximize results for our budget. Measurement is imperative: If you don\u2019t collect data on what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll never know if it\u2019s working.\u201d<\/em><\/blockquote>\r\n<h4><strong>Suggestion#2: Maximize the value of your leads with a nurture program!<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<blockquote><em>\u201cAs a B2B company, we know that people don\u2019t become a lead and then buy a product the next day,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe educate and nurture our leads so when they\u2019re ready to buy, our brand is top of mind. We use marketing automation software to run nurture email campaigns, score leads, and then forward qualified leads to our sales team. Nurturing gives us the maximum benefit of the leads we acquire through LinkedIn\u2019s Sponsored Content. If we didn\u2019t nurture our leads, we\u2019d miss out on the vast majority of people who are interested in learning about our product and purchasing at a later time.\u201d<\/em><\/blockquote>\r\n<h4><strong>Suggestion#3: Match your content to your audience!<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<blockquote><em>\u201cWe serve specific content to targeted audiences and organize LinkedIn advertising campaigns around those audiences,\u201d Pedigo says. \u201cCustomizing copy and artwork around audiences is a\u00a0<\/em><em>high priority. If we\u2019re serving eBook content around mobile strategy best practices, we\u2019ll use different art and copy that resonates with a CMO versus a CTO.\u201d<\/em><\/blockquote>\r\n<h4><strong>Suggestion#4: Test multiple targeting facets and creatives!<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<blockquote><em>\u201cWe\u2019re running 20 to 50 campaigns weekly and continuously A\/B testing different copy and artwork,\u201d Pedigo says. \u201cWe make adjustments in real time. For example, we discovered that using cool colors such as green, blue, and purple in ad artwork improved our CTR by 25 percent. We compare CTR diligently because we know that LinkedIn, like every social platform, optimizes for CTR and shows content less often when engagement drops. That\u2019s why we prioritize refreshing art and copy for Sponsored Content every week.\u201d<\/em><\/blockquote>\r\n<h4><strong>Suggestion#5: Seek campaign ideas from across your company!<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<blockquote><em>\u201cWe get ideas for content from both our sales and engineering teams,\u201d says Pedigo. \u201cThe marketing team is perpetually talking with sales about the types of questions they receive from leads. We also talk with engineering about topics that are emerging in the mobile space. In terms of process, we have an outsourced writer interview our developers about a topic we choose and then they place the content of the interview into an eBook. We have an in-house graphic designer that does the creative for all eBooks.\u201d<\/em><\/blockquote>\r\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><em>\u00a0<\/em><strong><em>Source:<\/em><\/strong><em> LinkedIn<\/em><\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Sneak Peak: Read this case study to know how a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider used LinkedIn Sponsored Content to generate 38% more leads at 65% lower cost.
