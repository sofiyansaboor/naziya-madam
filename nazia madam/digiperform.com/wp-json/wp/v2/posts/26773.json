The fact that an average user today prefers video content over conventional textual material is one of the main reasons for this popularity. Today, YouTube is the second most popular web search engines.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For video-making enthusiasts, this presents a host of opportunities. Firstly, you do not need to make any payment to start your YouTube channel. Thus, if you can come up with a digital marketing strategy that will appeal to the audience, you will be able to drive brand engagement.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As your channel gains popularity, brands will be interested in posting ads on your channel, thereby driving home better profits. In this article, we shall talk about how you can use YouTube to generate passive income for yourself.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Come Up with Compelling Titles<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have an established channel, with a good number of subscribers, you know that people will watch your videos if you can consistently deliver high-quality content. However, to be able to get people to watch your video and follow your channel, you need some compelling titles.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you can use the best YouTube intro maker to come up with a killer introduction to the video, the fact is that no one will watch it if the title isn\u2019t attractive. While keeping the title short (not exceeding 60 characters), try to incorporate keywords into it so that Google crawlers find it easier to identify your video. Identify the central idea of the video and tell that through your title so that potential viewers will be aware of how they stand to benefit from watching the video. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/videocreek.com\/make\/youtube-intro-maker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n<h2><\/h2>\r\n<h2><b>Keep Your Thumbnails Relevant and Recognizable<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chances of a potential customer judging your video by its thumbnail are significantly high, and that is why you should be cautious about keeping the thumbnail relevant to the video. Including a short description of the thumbnail is an effective tool of letting people know what the video is all about and thereby attracting people who are genuinely interested in it. You may also choose to include the video title itself in the thumbnail in a bid to attract more views.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a YouTube channel, try to be consistent in your videos and adhere to a single style in all your thumbnails. This will instill familiarity, and your loyal followers will not miss out on your video posts. If your thumbnail has exciting faces with focus on the eyes, potential viewers will relate to it at an emotional level, and that will increase their chances of watching the video.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a technical perspective, know that the YouTube players support thumbnails of aspect ratio 16:9 the best and restrict the format to JPG, GIF, or TIF. Stick to high-quality images for your thumbnail. If you are using a video, make sure it is either 1920 X 1080 or 1280 X 720 to avoid distortion of quality.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h2><b>Leverage on Your Brand Identity<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you come up with a YouTube channel of your own, you need to design your page in a way such that people can relate it with the brand. If you are a brand, make sure that you use the official company logo as the channel\u2019s picture. For independent accounts, a headshot would be ideal.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-branded overlays are an effective way of catching the attention of the people and having them watch the videos.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Update the bio with relevant details that will give the brand a personality of its own. For individual YouTube channels, talk about your likes and dislikes in the bio section, so that your followers get to know you better and can relate with you at a personal level.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h2><b>Keep Videos Short and Effective<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the attention span of the average viewer coming down by the day, if you are keen to make the most of your videos, try to restrict their length. Try to come up with interesting subjects and create informative content around it. You may choose to experiment with the length of your videos to find out what works best for you.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, videos that are of less than a 5-minute length report higher user engagement than longer ones. An <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/videocreek.com\/make\/outro-maker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">efficient way<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of ensuring that the viewer retains the core message of your 5-minute video is to use an outro maker to come up with a poignant outro that will strike a chord with the viewer.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h2><b>Look for YouTube Collaborations<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent trend that has gained immense popularity is that of YouTube collaborations. Here, you look for brands that are more powerful than you, and we create a video with them. The brand may be an influencer with millions of followers, a top manufacturing brand, a celebrity cricketer, or anyone else.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don&#8217;t need to collaborate with only one brand or individual. You may choose to connect with multiple influential people from one or more fields at a time. You may even choose to organize a live session with your followers to have a better picture of the type of video content that they expect from you.<\/span>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h2><b>Promote Your Videos<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is important to learn <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qvGyQEqt61w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to edit videos for YouTube<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the determining factor in the success of a video is how well it is being shared. If you are keen on growing your YouTube channel, you need to go beyond YouTube and share your videos through Facebook, WhatsApp, Pinterest, Twitter email newsletters, etc.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to be active in Social media groups and add the link to your YouTube channel in your Instagram bio. Sharing your thoughts on professional groups of Google+ and LinkedIn will give you industry visibility and help you to drive YouTube traffic.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to making money on your YouTube channel lies in achieving popularity and having a good number of subscribers. It is only when you deliver quality content in a way that attracts the viewer\u2019s attention that you will be able to achieve the number of followers you had dreamt of. With the tips discussed in this article, you are now better equipped to understand the finer nuances of creating a high-quality video channel and make a name for your brand in the digital world.<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"In recent years, there has been a steady growth in the popularity of YouTube as a content marketing platform.
