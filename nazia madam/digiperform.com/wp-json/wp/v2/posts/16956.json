And if your emails don\u2019t read well on the mobile then you\u2019re in trouble. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is an example showing the difference between a <a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/enhance-internet-presence-tips-optimize-page-titles-mobile-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile-optimized<\/a> and non-optimized email:<\/span>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/vs.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-16958 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/vs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"534\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let&#8217;s get to it.

Consequently, imagine through where your email subscribers will first see your email. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>5# Interact like a real person<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the subject line one more essential thing that draws attention is sender name, which helps the recipient to make a decision, whether hit it off to spam, Move to Trash or still read the newsletter. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when the reader knows that it comes from a trustworthy sender the reader would be more likely to open it, isn&#8217;t it?<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s always good to use your domain name in the address of email campaigns. If your mailing address is ordinary and doesn\u2019t have your company name, then your readers will not be able to find out who wrote this email.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the contact person with a familiar address can enhance your email reliability.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Example: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/sender-name-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-16960 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/sender-name-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"644\" height=\"318\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h2><b>6# Add social sharing buttons.<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no point in sending emails if the content of the email is not shareable by the readers.

The former will allow your email recipients to pass along the offer URL in your email to their followers. The latter will prompt them to Like, follow, or add your company social media channels.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like;\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can Simplify sharing with ready-made tweets.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Readers or recipients look for easy options if they need to take an action. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even they are too lazy to tweet the wonderful content you sent them via email.
