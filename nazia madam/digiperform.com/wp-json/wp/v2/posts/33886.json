One of the ways that clearly stands out is web scraping\/crawling. With web crawlers, you can gather and analyze information faster, conveniently, and in a highly affordable manner.\r\n\r\nYou must not even purchase crawlers. You can make your own with methods such as python coding, browsers\u2019 extension, or even use data extraction tools such as Zenscrape.\r\n\r\nDespite the flexibility in creating\/accessing crawlers and the benefits that web scraping offers, there are still hurdles when it comes to usage. There are sites that you can\u2019t access even if you have crawlers. In some cases, you\u2019ll only scrape information to a certain level.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor is captcha solving, if your scraping efforts aren\u2019t able to go through it, you won\u2019t get any data and you would be wasting your bandwidth. You can find a lot of comprehensive information on how to go around this issue\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/proxyway.com\/guides\/how-to-bypass-captcha\">by reading this guide<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIt is the work of the same web developers to create anti-scraping tools. With this, they make sure that they win either way (from the information owners and the information seekers). So, do you feel like the crawlers you have are not serving their intended purpose because of limited usage? We have good news for you- You can still go around all the obstacles that prevent you from crawling.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will discuss two easy techniques that you can use to beat anti-scraping. Let\u2019s dive directly into them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. IP Address<\/h3>\r\nYour Internet Protocol address is like an identity that is held responsible for all activities that you perform on a site. Websites will track your IP if they notice some weird behavior and try to establish if the activities under your IP are human or robotic. If your IP address makes very many requests simultaneously within a particular period (which is obviously what a scraping bot will do), the website may block it.\r\n\r\nSo, when are your scraping activities likely to be suspected and blocked?\r\n\r\n\u2022 When you send too many requests within a very short period- Websites assume that humans are generally slower and that there is a certain number of requests they are supposed to send in a given period.\r\n\r\nSolution:\u00a0Reduce the request you send in a given period. Leverage techniques such as \u2018sleep\u2019 function or increasing waiting time between two requests.\r\n\r\n\u2022 When you are always visiting a website at the same time- Again, websites don\u2019t expect humans to clock some level of accuracy and consistency and hence will treat highly accurate and consistently timed activities as scraping.\r\n\r\nSolution:\u00a0Make the scraping speed random\r\n\r\n\u2022 Consistent requests from varying IPs- Even if your crawler uses various IPs, the activities\/requests should not be timed at a particular time as this will be recognized by advanced anti-scraping techniques.\r\n\r\nSolution:\u00a0Use rotating IPs with random scraping speeds.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>2. Captchas<\/h3>\r\n\u2018Captcha\u2019 is the contraction of \u2018Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers And Humans Apart. The Captcha is the kind of image that prompts you to do certain tasks such as clicking particular items or doing some calculations in order to access the content of a page.\r\n\r\nCaptchas\u2019 main aim is to dictate tasks that only humans can tackle and not robots.\r\n\r\nThe use of Captchas has evolved to be one of the most effective anti-scraping techniques for website owners. Although it has been hard for web crawlers to pass this obstacle in the past, now there is an open-source tool that you can use to bypass all Captcha challenges when using crawlers.\r\n\r\nThe open-source tool, however, is not one of the easiest to create. It requires high proficiency in programming.\r\n\r\nAnother way people use to beat Captcha obstacles is making feature libraries that enable the creation of image recognition techniques using high-end learning or machine skills. Again, this may not be suitable for you and that\u2019s why you still need a better solution.\r\n\r\nThe most promising and easiest way to beat anti-scraping when you are not the person who will spend hours and hours coding is simply reducing your scraping activities. This way, you\u2019ll trick the anti-scraping features not to focus on your scraping tools. Eventually, the suspicion will be over and you\u2019ll be able to crawl the website without any limitations.\r\n<b><\/b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Wrapping up<\/h3>\r\nWe hope you have enjoyed this post and now know how you can beat anti-scraping and proceed with your information crawling as normal. No matter how fun solving captchas automatically may look to you, it requires very advanced skills and unless you are the finest in the game, you should stick to the IPs tricks.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]In this digital era, good access to content and data from online sources may be all you need to have the upper hand in the occupation you are in.
