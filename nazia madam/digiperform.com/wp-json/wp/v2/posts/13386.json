I still feel there are many people who are not aware of the scope of digital marketing. So let me share with all my buddies what Digital Marketing is all about? What are the career options in the digital marketing?<\/span>\r\n<b>What is Digital Marketing?<\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-13202 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/dgm1-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"437\" height=\"437\" \/><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital Marketing is the online form of marketing that helps marketers and businessmen to promote and advertise products and services with the help the Internet and digital devices. It is a set of marketing online tools and strategies. Digital Marketing is a universal skill hacks growth for the company and businesses.<\/span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<b>Why is Digital Marketing a promising choice for your career?<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>No specific Educational Background:<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The drawback of any industry is that they need professionals of specific backgrounds which make the jobs not approachable to every job seekers. However, Digital Marketing is all about the internet and the biggest testament to the democratization that digital media has brought into our jobs market and for same for which you don\u2019t need a specific set of qualifications. Your passion and love for internet are all matters. Another best aspect of digital marketing is you don\u2019t have to begin your career from scratch if you want to make it big in the business. All you need is Skill.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Choose what sector interests you:<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital marketing is a huge industry and there is a lot going on under the umbrella. You can master a multitude of roles in digital marketing for a wide variety of roles and skills as per your interest in the internet. You can become content or email marketer, social media or mobile marketer, e-commerce executive, inbound marketer, an SEO or PPC executive or you can be an online PR expert. <\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Lucrative job opportunities <\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand for a skilled digital marketer is getting on nerves and not only in India itself, worldwide. There are more than 3.9 billion internet users all over the world and very less professional digital marketers to cover them which makes it exceedingly rare to find that there aren\u2019t any job opportunities in the area. The multinational companies are always hiring on the urge and are in need for more skilled marketers. So you will find the job opportunities everywhere. Also, when supply is less while demand is more, it goes without saying that a good digital marketer will get big bucks. Plus, the higher you go up the ladder, so does your pay scale.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>You\u2019ll be in high demand<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what field of business you are in; whether its hospitality, production, media etc, marketing is going to be the true winner. Also, businesses are crying out to tune themselves into digital just because people are more reluctantly depended on the internet for their chores. Though the availability of skilled digital marketers is less in the market as compared to the need. During the decade, the awareness regarding Digital Marketing is rising so as the demand for skilled Digital Marketers. The skills gap that we\u2019re currently seeing shows a total of 180,000 jobs that with the same pace will be available in 2020, but with not enough professionals to fill each of these jobs.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital Marketing is not just limited to companies, even political leaders are greatly relying on digital marketing to grow their influence. You must have seen Narendra Modi or Donald Trump\u2019s sensational campaigns all over online platforms which are the unseen hand of digital marketing only. The Companies need good digital marketers who can conduct high-quality campaigns help build brands from scratch. Remember, it\u2019s this scarcity that has created great demand.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Get More Paid:<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, it\u2019s the simple law of supply and demand. Since the demand is so high for your digital marketable services and the supply is so low, the pay will only lead to go up and perhaps even skyrocket. With this to count on, you\u2019ll be able to negotiate your salary with any prospective employer and grab highly paid jobs. This bar is set to high for the next five years. It\u2019s not only the managerial positions that are going through an increase in salary amount. Even entry-level positions are seeing a sizeable increase in salary.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Raise yourself to be an Entrepreneur<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your experience in digital marketing, will not only get you better job opportunities but will be immensely helpful if you are planning to become an entrepreneur in coming years. You will have a better understanding of customers\u2019 needs better, evaluate the market fitness of products and assess demand in the market than others who are new to this.
