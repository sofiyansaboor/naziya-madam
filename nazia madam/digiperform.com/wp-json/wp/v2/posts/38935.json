Email is one of the easiest and most convenient ways to communicate, and the amount of email users keeps increasing year after year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with that increasing number, email strategists have been finding new, improved ways of promoting their businesses or products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Why You Should Use Email Marketing<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email marketing campaigns are the go-to choice of many marketers, including digital marketing. The reason this form of marketing is so popular is because of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescommunicationscouncil\/2020\/07\/03\/three-reasons-email-is-hitting-its-stride-in-middle-age\/#:~:text=Over%20the%20years%2C%20email%20has,%2438%20for%20every%20%241%20spent.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highest ROI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Return On Investment. With little money invested, you can expect sure returns and an increase in leads. However, some preparation is necessary, as forming the email list itself is a never-ending process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>The Best Writing Tools for an Effective Email Campaign<\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make your job easy, we\u2019ve done some work ourselves. We\u2019ve dug through the Internet in search of the best tools for an email campaign. So, here are the top seven tools to build a successful email marketing campaign:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>1. Vero<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When dealing with a large number of contacts, instead of sending one and the same email to everyone, Vero helps with creating customized emails. It helps with the personalization of the content being sent out, focusing on the individual interests of users. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This tool will make sure to provide the most effective emails to potential customers or consumers, saving you time and effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>2. Grammarly<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though businesses want to appear friendly and open, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that it\u2019s still necessary to stay professional. Grammarly is a great tool as not only does it correct grammatical and spelling mistakes, but it also suggests better wording so that you can adjust your style and tone and communicate effectively. It is very user-friendly and can be used with many desktop apps as well as on many different websites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>3. Google Keyword Planner<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Google Keyword Planner helps you come up with the best and most effective keywords for your business. It\u2019s a free tool that will provide suggestions of phrases most suitable to your needs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It promotes products and services not only on Google but also on YouTube, Bing, Amazon, and other websites. It also helps businesses with reaching specific goals, for example, reaching a higher number of clicks on their website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>4. Hire a Writing Service<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you could hire professionals to do the work for you. A service called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lords-of-paper.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lords-of-paper.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides writing services and ensures that you get what you need. With a number of experts in various fields, negotiating the final product is a piece of cake and is sure to provide you with appropriate content for your marketing campaign.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the best solution if you ever feel stuck and have a lack of inspiration to come up with catchy phrases and relatable content so necessary in the field. The thing is, everybody has days like this, but knowing how to overcome them without compromising your work or missing deadlines is the way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For this reason, many professionals decide to outsource their writing and focus on editing and corrections. With this in mind, let\u2019s keep going.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>5. Community<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no better place to seek the advice of professionals, available 24\/7. If you ever get stuck in the middle of an email, not knowing how to continue, or not knowing how to start even, you can ask for advice or a template to aid you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea behind the community is that people from different fields are brought together and can cooperate on various projects using the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cliently.com\/blog\/how-to-start-a-community-outreach-program\">Community platform<\/a><\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>6. Hemingway App<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hemingway App is one of the best tools you can use to make your emails more comprehensible. Needless to say, an average reader does not want to get lost in 3-line sentences. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hemingway App scans your content and ensures that the sentences are simple to read, comprehensible, and of appropriate length. Considering that Google also scans the content for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/the-sentence-length-check\/#:~:text=Using%20shorter%20sentences%20makes%20your,read%2C%20and%20easy%20to%20comprehend.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ease of reading<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this platform is also useful when publishing content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Zapier\u00a0<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zapier is an advanced automation tool. What Zapier does is that it allows you to transform long processes into automatic patterns that take over high-volume jobs. Zapier allows you to set up a series of timed emails that are timed to each individual user to send reminders and increase your engagement and conversion rates. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zapier does come at a price, but considering the time saved, it pays off in no time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is very difficult to run a modern business without a successful marketing campaign. However, it is not that easy of a task to come up with new and original ideas and stay on top of the competition. That is where the above-listed tools come in very handy. Some of them are free and available to everyone, some do require fees, and it is up to you to choose one (or more) which fits your needs perfectly. Email Marketing investments have the highest ROI, so you can be sure that your investment will pay off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Author\u2019s bio<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jessica Fender is a writer who believes that strong discipline is the key to success in any branch.
