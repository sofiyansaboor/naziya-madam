One out of three clothes purchases made online is returned. This rate of return is unacceptable for other industries. Imagine if one out of every three mobiles got return from customers, or one out of three travelers canceled their hotel booking.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Online retailer, you have to understand that customers are unable to try on clothes. They are limited to touch and feel the product. They cannot figure out the right size and they would probably get confused with size variants such as regular US size, UK size, plus size, slim fit, Petite size, etc. That is why fitting is the top reason that customers make returns.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most of the online apparel stores use size charts as a tool to help shoppers make fit decisions but those return rates are not decreasing. One of the reasons is because those size charts place a burden on customers who may not even have a measuring tape to size themselves up with or don\u2019t know how to do it correctly.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clothing stores need a reliable tool to help improve sales at a lower cost. They would choose to be able to provide more accurate measurements for the customers, lower return and less complaints to handle. Also, less inquiries from customers about the sizes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the solution for apparel ecommerce stores is to move on from using those outdated sizing charts or costly unreliable technologies, and instead just get the size recommender application.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sixatomic.com\/envision-size-fit-analyser\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Envision Size &amp; Fit Analyser<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses artificial intelligence-driven (AI) analyzed tens of thousands of bodies and develop predictive models that are over 97%+ accurate for 50 detailed measurements. It\u2019s a smart size analyzer application that guides customers to buy the right size. Customers can get an accurate size analysis in under a minute, wherever they may be in the world. They just need to answer simple questions, like their height, weight, typical sizes, and body shape. No size charts, or tape measures required.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all realize the disappointment of ordering clothes online but when we receive them, they don\u2019t fit. So, this application is designed to help store owners to identify the specification of the product, reduce the return rates, reduce abandoned carts due to sizing issues and guide customers to buy the right size using their height, weight, typical sizes, and body shape.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By integrating this app to help shoppers make better fit decisions, online retailers can reduce return rates and customers have more confidence in making a purchase when they are shown exactly how the product will fit them. Also, they will be more confident to revisit the site and make more purchases in the future.\u00a0<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"In the online apparel industry, the return rate is at least around 30%. as compared to 8.89% in brick-and-mortar stores. 92% of consumers surveyed said that they will buy again if product return process is easy whereas 79% of consumers&#8230;","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":39649,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[39],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 -
