If you want to take SEO as a career then you have to make sure that you are ready to spend long hours in front of your system not only at your office but even at your home, not only for your company but for keeping yourself updated, being a SEO is not a profession but an addiction.<\/p>\r\nOne thing that you need to take note of will be that people will keep on abusing search engines with low quality content &amp; fishy methods in future too and the search engines will keep on updating their algorithms to ridicule them, so you have to make sure that you are following good resources to get updates on what\u2019s in &amp; out of SEO and experimenting with these strategies on your website.\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #2144ad;\"><b>1.\u00a0<\/b><b>SEO Intern:<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\nIf you are starting up fresh in SEO industry then generally you have to start as an SEO Intern. Although there are no key perquisites that you need to have to be an SEO intern but companies prefer people who can do bit of research online or have a proficiency in using Excel &amp; Word but these skills can be developed within a span of 6-7 days so don\u2019t you worry about them.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Key Responsibilities:<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Carrying content research for executives<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Updating Meta tags of website as per the excel provided<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Content submission<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Link submissions<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOr all the low key SEO related manual work possible in an organization.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Experience in SEO: <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nFresher\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Monthly Compensation: (INR)<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\n4,000\u2013 6,000\r\nYes, that\u2019s a fact most of these companies are looking for cheap labor instead of a person that they can really groom into a good resource. So they will let you learn at your own pace but will make sure that they can take out what they are putting into you.\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">My Suggestion:<\/span><\/h4>\r\nRather than applying as a direct SEO Intern to a company in India it\u2019s always better to go for a paid training in SEO as a fresher. This will not only prepare you for a direct entry to Executive Level (and a much Better compensation) but will also save six months of your career at least.\r\nCheck the reality yourself. Below is an internship opportunity at a <strong>Top Ecommerce company in India<\/strong>. Since, I don\u2019t want to directly take a dig at them I have blurred their name.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Picture1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Picture1.png\" alt=\"Low salary to seo freshers india\" width=\"529\" height=\"242\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #2144ad;\"><b>2.\u00a0<\/b><b>SEO Executive:<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\nWelcome aboard, this is actually the first job role that will make you see the World of SEO.
