They are required to specify where they are getting the information from.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>What for Users?<\/h3>\r\nWith this update, the users will be allowed to view more specific information around \u201c<b><i>why an ad is displayed\u201d<\/i><\/b>\u00a0in their News Feed in order to provide the best user experience without any hindrance (under EU\u2019s GDPR Guidelines).\r\n\r\nWhenever a user clicks on the \u201c<b><i>Why am I seeing this<\/i><\/b>?\u201d in an ad\u2019s drop-down menu, they would get to know the source behind the information on the Customer Audience List.\r\n\r\nThrough this, the user would get to know if the advertiser has reached them via phone or email address to avail his\/her permission.\r\n\r\nAlso from July 2 onwards, the parties sharing customer files to build Customer Audience List will need to confirm the audience sharing relationship via\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/home\/accounts?business_id=502603136793846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook Business Manager tool<\/a>, with both parties agreeing to Facebook\u2019s Custom Audience terms. This update is important in the case when a brand on Facebook shares its customer list with its ad agency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\r\nThe agenda behind the update is to deliver more accountability and transparency around advertising.\r\n\r\nFacebook is trying every effort to ensure that the company has been promising since news broke that Cambridge Analytica used an app on Facebook to harvest and exploit user data.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"[vc_row pix_particles_check=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text]According to earlier Facebook\u2019s update in April, Facebook\u2019s new\u00a0Custom Audience Permission Tool\u00a0will require user consent confirmation to display their ads in the News Feed.
