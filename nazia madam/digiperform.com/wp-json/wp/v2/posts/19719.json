Most of the consumers, before buying a product or hiring a service, read the brand\u2019s review, opinions, and comments of other users on Google or social media networks. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, although even your business is the best in the world, still the time comes when it<\/span><b> appears in the so-called trolls and negative criticisms<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And, being a big entity, one should know how to handle these crises. <\/span>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-19724 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/blog-118-300x274.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"339\" height=\"310\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s see how we should handle them. <\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>What is a troll?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the language of the Internet, a troll characterizes a message, a debate or a person whose objective is to <\/span><b>generate\/create controversy<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-19726 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/TRIVAGO7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"378\" height=\"423\" \/><\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not far from the image of an evil and unfortunate being, and, a troll, generally, hides behind the screen to distribute its poison unjustifiably and harm a brand, company or person.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet, Social media marketing, and blogs have always been defenders of the rights of expression and this is the main reason why it is very difficult to avoid a troll.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Why do trolls exist?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ve just started your business, your audience is very receptive and everything seems to be going like clockwork, but there comes a troll who devotes all his soul to stain your reputation and denigrate your work. Why? Well, because the world is not a perfect place. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your success is envious and you will have to know how to keep quiet so as not to waste time and effort on people who don&#8217;t deserve it. People do not like that something is not to their liking, and trolls are a perfect example. But, maybe, in the end, having a troll isn&#8217;t so bad\u2026..Why?<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Are negative criticisms positive?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are different types of criticism on the web: <\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it can range from malicious criticism that is made to harm the company, or<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to constructive criticism that indirectly improves its image. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, you should know how to handle criticism or a negative comment on the Internet, since we all know <\/span><b>the importance of the Internet to the entrepreneur.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0The trace of your good or bad reaction will remain for life on the net, so you better be careful.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Steps to follow:<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing you have to do is breathe and relativize. Always think that <\/span><b>criticism can be favorable for you and become an opportunity.<\/b>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main mistake made by beginners is to hide or even delete the negative comment on the web, and this is not the way to go. You have to face criticism even if it is more or less justified.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give a quick answer. Before the silence, the nerves rise and your troll will only duplicate his efforts so that the world knows his bad experience. As long as there are two or three people agreeing with the same thing, not giving an answer will make room for a chain of &#8220;me too&#8221;.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t get carried away. Some comments may not be respectful. Don&#8217;t fall into the trap. Take a deep breath and try to put yourself in the place of your interlocutor. Education is one of the bases for maintaining a quality relationship with customers. Be as friendly as possible. The troll may focus on your problem and not value it, but others will appreciate the patience with a person of bad faith. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your company offers, for example, telecommunications services, such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonvirtual.com\/en\/call-center-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call Center software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, PBX&#8230; there are probably numerous trolls, dedicated to the same sector (or not) that want to sink you. <\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Types of Trolls<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the general attitude has been clarified, we will make a small focus on the different types of trolls you can find on the Web and the best way to deal with each of them.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h2><b>The Proud Trolls.<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proud trolls are little spies hidden in the shadows, ready to do anything to prove that they know everything better than the others. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, their first comments are not negative. They seem to be interested in a product, service or publication by asking fairly easy questions. Little by little, the questions become more and more specific and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re expected to attack. <\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These types of trolls are experts in their field and are very pretentious. The only purpose of their comments is to show that they are better than you, and if they can destroy you along the way, believe us, they will.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To answer the proud trolls, don&#8217;t ignore them, or else they&#8217;ll bother you. Answer as quickly as possible, politely, trying to avoid the traps you have left. If they attack you, it&#8217;s because the proud trolls see you as competition. So trust your knowledge.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2><b>The Envious Trolls.<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Envious trolls are unpleasant and bitter individuals who, faced with the success of others, spit out their poison. If your products are successful, your publications are commented very positively or if you have a famous blog, the envious troll will be there to ruin your moment. In the slightest detail, their jealousy will take over their reason and negative comments will merge.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Against envious trolls, the ideal is not to respond to provocation. Each of your responses will lead to another because these types of trolls are professionals in the practice of deaf language. Before reacting to an envious troll, remember that &#8220;<\/span><b><i>ignorance is the worst contempt<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2><b>The Amateur Trolls<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An amateur troll bothers for pleasure. The negative comments are not motivated by jealousy or the desire to appear. These people are simply critics. They like to leave comments that destroy you for no reason, just for the sake of doing harm.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amateur trolls are not used to following a real conversation. In general, they spit out their poison and don&#8217;t come back. To handle these negative comments, take your patience and respond to something basic to make it look good, such as: &#8220;<\/span><b><i>We regret that our article\/product\/ service is not to your liking. Thank you for coming back<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;.<\/span>\r\n<h4><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re subject to valid negative comments, or not, know that you&#8217;re not the only one. In addition to following our tips for managing these comments, you&#8217;ll need patience.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two or three trolls are nothing compared to billions of people on the net. If your response is appropriate, these small inconveniences will become charms for your customers or potential readers.<\/span>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you have the weapons to fight these trolls that bother you. Take advantage of this opportunity and respond by demonstrating your tact, your elegance and especially your professionalism.
