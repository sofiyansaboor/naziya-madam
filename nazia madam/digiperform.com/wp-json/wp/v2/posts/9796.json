The company helps its customers in easy &amp; smooth relocation that includes everything from moving boxes to packing specialists and movers. Brian Scudamore planned to launch this company after he experienced a challenging move with his family. The company as of now has 34 franchises in Canada and the United States.\r\nYouMoveMe powers U.S. expansion by targeting content to entrepreneurs as well as sales and real estate professionals. The company wanted to achieve qualified leads for franchise opportunities as well as target campaigns to professionals in key industries and experience levels. The moving &amp; packing brand turned to LinkedIn and picked Sponsored Content and InMails for highlighting connection to 1-800-GOT-JUNK? brand together with personal messages from CEO.\r\nWith the help of LinkedIn Sponsored Content and InMails, the company could increase average LinkedIn engagement rate for Sponsored Content by 3 times\u00a0 while achieving a 150% increase in traffic to You Move Me franchise webpage and 2X conversion for leads from LinkedIn.\r\n<h3><strong>Reaching the right segment of the audience<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nYouMoveMe has already been using social media for building its brand among consumers and highlighting its business growth, since the company was incepted. When the company decided to expand its network of franchise locations in the United States, it turned to social media for promoting itself to potential franchise owners, progressing the franchise publications &amp; online news portals that it mainly used as platforms for advertising.\r\n\u201cWhile we got some interest from the franchise news sources, we didn\u2019t find as many qualified leads\u2014they were tire kickers,\u201d says Brian Scudamore, CEO of You Move Me. \u201cWe had no way to target our messages and talk to the people most likely to want to buy a You Move Me franchise.\u201d This kind of person, Scudamore says, was most likely working in transportation, sales, real estate, or other entrepreneurial industries, and had been in their career for 10 to 15 years. \u201cThey might be looking for a change from corporate life, or for the chance to own their own business,\u201d Scudamore explains.\r\nThe main reasons that led YouMoveMe\u2019s marketing team to LinkedIn was bringing the opportunity to the place where these targets were conducting their business as well as researching new opportunities.\r\n\u201cWith LinkedIn, we pinpointed who we wanted to reach, in a place where people are doing business all day,\u201d Scudamore says. \u201cWe could also leverage the 1-800-GOT-JUNK? brand, which would give people confidence in the opportunity and make them want to learn more.\u201d\r\n<h3><strong>Delivering the messages based on industry, location, and experience <\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThe marketing team at YouMoveMe settled o using Sponsored Content for reaching potential franchise owners that allowed relevant offers &amp; updates to show beside organic content in members\u2019 LinkedIn feeds.\r\n\u201cWe placed our messages about You Move Me directly in front of the people most likely to respond to the opportunity,\u201d Scudamore says.\r\nThe team focused on delivering the content to the LinkedIn members with 10-15 years of experience in key industries and to those who were located in geographic areas where the brand wanted to set up franchises.\r\nAdvertising the new business opportunity and the connection to the 1-800-GOT-JUNK? Brand, the Sponsored Content also paid attention to a personal pitch from Scudamore.\r\n\u201cWe like to talk about how our franchise owners help build the business\u2014we&#8217;re not just trying to sell them something,\u201d\u00a0Scudamore explains.\r\n\u201cLinkedIn Sponsored Content and InMails have brought more potential franchise owners to our website than any other marketing campaign we\u2019ve done. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re receiving qualified leads that are far more likely to turn into You Move Me franchise owners.\u201d\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_9799\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9799\" style=\"width: 349px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9799\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/YouMoveMe-1.png\" alt=\"YouMoveMe LinkedIn Marketing \" width=\"349\" height=\"168\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9799\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">YouMoveMe LinkedIn Marketing<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_9798\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9798\" style=\"width: 368px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9798 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/YouMoveMe-2.png\" alt=\"YouMoveMe LinkedIn Marketing\" width=\"368\" height=\"147\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">YouMoveMe LinkedIn Marketing<\/figcaption><\/figure>\r\n<h3><strong>Generating qualified leads with higher conversion<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nThe targeting capabilities &amp; creative tools offered by LinkedIn for reaching out to the right professionals at the right time helped YouMoveMe in effectively attracting a new audience of possible franchise owners.\r\nWhile Sponsored Content helped the brand in increasing the engagement rates by 3 times higher than average LinkedIn benchmarks, InMails helped them in achieving a clickthrough rate that was 2 times the average rates as well as open rates 5 times the average.\r\nThe high rates of engagement not just helped the brand in translating it into quality leads but also these leads generated from LinkedIn converted at twice the rate of other leads.
