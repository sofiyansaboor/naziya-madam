You can also use keywords that you want to target.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">Add photos of your office, staff, products, or photos with dealing with customers. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">Open your GMB dashboard-click on the info button and complete all the details, also complete the advanced information section.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><span class=\"s7\"><b>2- G<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>et on the Google maps-<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">If your business is not located on Google maps; then, it affects your ranking. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">For getting on the Google maps- search for your business in the maps if it appears then claim the listing and if it doesn\u2019t appear, then add it as a place to maps and claim the listing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><span class=\"s9\"><b>3- G<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>et a website<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">Google provides its free website, but still, I recommend you to make a good quality website why I am saying because Google receives 21% signals from the website. Make sure your website is responsive and mobile-friendly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">Properly optimize the title tag, Meta tag, Meta description.
