Well, apart from the numbers at the end of each month\u2019s financial report, you may also want to pay a bit more attention to your online presence.\r\n\r\nAccording to Investopedia,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/040915\/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp\">90% of startups<\/a>\u00a0doing amazing things end up going bust within ten years of their founding. Now that\u2019s not just worrying. It also brings forth existential questions such as: are business ventures even worth investing in?\r\n\r\nThe short answer is a\u00a0<b>resounding yes<\/b>. However, if you want to make your startup into a business that\u2019ll keep you fed, clothed, and with a roof over your head for years to come, you\u2019re going to need more than great products and a stellar business strategy. SEO is going to be one of those essential tactics for success.\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, the following are the steps you need to take if you want to make it in today\u2019s market.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>1. Understanding the Difference Between Paid and Organic Traffic<\/h3>\r\nIf you look at the definition of SEO, you\u2019ll find that it stands for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/how-exactly-does-seo-help-in-digital-marketing\/\">Search Engine Optimization<\/a>. Essentially, the term denotes a set of activities that are implemented to drive traffic to your website. Ideally, you don\u2019t just want\u00a0<b>more<\/b>\u00a0traffic, but you also want to get the\u00a0<b>right<\/b>\u00a0traffic.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s put it this way: you don\u2019t want just anyone coming to your website, then clicking away in under ten seconds after they\u2019ve realized it\u2019s not the right thing for them. You want your target audience to land and, more importantly, stick around.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you need to understand about SEO, that is, organic traffic, is that it isn\u2019t a replacement for other marketing strategies. Yes, getting to the top of a SERP is the goal. However, unless you\u2019ve got years to wait, you\u2019ll need to spend money on paid advertising.\r\n\r\nBut, while the bad news is that you do need a padded budget to get your startup off the ground, there\u2019s good news as well. And that is, you can\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zerogravitymarketing.com\/increase-your-organic-traffic-with-ppc\/\">use both paid and free traffic data<\/a>\u00a0to continually improve your advertising strategies, ultimately ensuring the biggest bang for your buck.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>2. Research &amp; Define<\/h3>\r\nSo, now that you understand that SEO isn\u2019t an all-in-one solution but rather one part of your marketing strategy, it\u2019s time to start getting more of that sweet free traffic.\r\n\r\nJust like with any other business undertaking, you\u2019ll need to start with research. To be able to promote, represent, and place your brand as the answer to your target audience\u2019s needs, you need to have a strong understanding of three things:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Your market and niche<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b><\/b>Having\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">insightful knowledge about your industry<\/a>\u00a0is a key element to making the right business decisions for your brand. Ultimately, you need to know the exact type of products and services available currently, the products that consumers want but that aren\u2019t available, the challenges within the industry, as well as the opportunities your competition still hasn\u2019t realized.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Your competitors<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b><\/b>Once you\u2019ve got a solid understanding of the state of things in your niche, you\u2019ll want to analyze the brands you\u2019ll be going up against. What do they do? Are they good at it? What marketing strategies do they use?\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/startupresources.io\/collection\/seo\/\">SEO tools<\/a>\u00a0like Ahrefs or SEMrush will help you get to the bottom of what they\u2019re doing and give you clear guidelines on possible SEO strategies. You will also want to identify the instances where they can improve. And most importantly, identify the aspects of business where you can do a better job answering consumer needs.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Your target audience<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFinally, the last preparatory phase in your research is going to be a deep dive into the needs, motivations, and characteristics of your target audience. You\u2019ll need to create buyer personas, identify their behaviors, challenges, and motivators. Ultimately, making a startup successful isn\u2019t about millions of one-time sales but rather about creating a loyal audience who\u2019ll be happy to recommend your products to the people in their social circle.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve got these three basics covered, you\u2019ll be well on your way to taking all the right steps to success.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>3. Study User Intent &amp; the Sales Funnel<\/h3>\r\nOnce you know what you\u2019re up against, it\u2019s time to set some goals. But how exactly do you do that with SEO?\r\n\r\nWell, to create a plan of action for getting organic traffic to your website, you\u2019ll need to take into consideration the fact that not all of your potential customers are the same. In fact, if you look at the sales funnel, you\u2019ll find that there are three main sections of the buyer journey:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Awareness<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Consideration<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Purchase<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s quite important to set goals for each stage of the funnel, taking the necessary steps to get people from all these stages of the buyer journey to visit your website.\r\n\r\nIn the\u00a0<b>awareness stage<\/b>, your users are still in the research phase. Perhaps they have a problem they require a solution to. Or, they might be looking for ways to do a thing on their own.\r\n\r\nWhichever the case, their searches are bound to be informational. They\u2019ll be using broad search terms and looking for highly informative content. In SEO terms, your goal in catering to the awareness stage should be\u00a0<b>providing educational content<\/b>, preferably free of charge. Create insightful resources, blog posts, videos, and ebooks (which can be gated), and optimize these pages with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/on-page-seo-vs-off-page-seo-which-is-more-important\/\">on-page SEO<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn the\u00a0<b>consideration stage<\/b>, your potential customers will already have a basic understanding of the topic. They will be looking at product\/service options, with the ultimate goal of making a purchase.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to SEO for these consumers, you will want to aim for two things. Firstly, they need to come to your landing page. You\u2019ll achieve this by optimizing your pages and distributing your content in the right way.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you\u2019ll want to ensure that the landing page is designed to convince. Basically, you want to show your visitors that your brand is the perfect answer to their needs. Ideally, they should be compelled to convert right away, either by signing up for a free trial, joining your mailing list, or contacting your sales team.\r\n\r\nThe last level of the sales funnel, the\u00a0<b>purchase stage,<\/b>\u00a0is where the consumer will already know that they want to buy from you. Here, you will want to minimize the number of steps it takes for a potential customer to become a buyer. If you are an eCommerce business, you will ideally get them straight from the SERP to the product page. Otherwise, you will want to give them clear\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/local-seo\/\">directions to your physical location<\/a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>4. Identify Keywords<\/h3>\r\nOnce you have a clear division between your audience segments, your hands-on SEO work can begin. Again, you\u2019ll have to do research, but being diligent about completing this step will ensure that your marketing strategies (free and paid) yield the desired results.\r\n\r\nMost business owners know about the concept of keywords, yet it\u2019s surprising how few of them truly understand the importance of using search terms in the right way. The standard course of action for businesses is often to only target \u2018seed\u2019 keywords. These are one or two-word terms that are related to their industry\/niche.\r\n\r\nBut, the thing is, they\u2019re unlikely to be enough to get you the results you need. The first reason for this is that there\u2019s too much competition for these terms. The second is that your audience is unlikely to search for something like \u2018fitness\u2019 if they\u2019re looking for a local gym that offers a Zumba class.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, you will need to dedicate a fair amount of time to do keyword research properly. Here is a short step-by-step guide on how to get started:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Identify the correct seed words for your industry. Try to think of as many as possible so that you have the highest chances of targeting relevant search terms that\u2019ll get potential customers to you.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Enter your seed keywords into a free tool like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/ko\/KeywordPlanner\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a>. Or, if you\u2019ve got the budget, invest in a solution like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\">Semrush<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keywords-explorer\">Ahrefs<\/a>, or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/\">Moz<\/a>. Here, you will be looking to collect as many relevant phrases as possible. Pay equal attention to short and long-tail keywords, and don\u2019t forget about questions either. All of these will come in handy once it\u2019s time to start producing your content.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Study your competitors. What search terms do they rank high for? What topics do they cover on their website? Is there anything they\u2019re doing that you still aren\u2019t?<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Move away from search engines and take a deep dive into more in-depth resources. Look at topics on websites like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/\">Quora<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/reddit.com\/\">Reddit<\/a>. Moreover, visit a few industry-oriented forums to see what people are asking\/discussing.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Finally, study the keywords you came up with. What\u2019s their search volume, traffic potential, difficulty, and CPC? Moreover, look at how they rank per location, as well as if there are any seasonal fluctuations in popularity. All of this data will come in handy in determining your content marketing strategy, as it\u2019ll give you guidelines on how to invest your energy to get the best possible results out of your efforts.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>5. Create &amp; Distribute Content<\/h3>\r\nNow that you\u2019ve done your share of research, you can start working on your data-driven content marketing strategy. Seeing that you have a strong understanding of your niche, audience, and keywords that will get you to the top of SERPs, you will want to get started with producing high-quality content for your website and social media channels.\r\n\r\nIf you plan on your main content marketing activity relying on your blog, pay attention to on-page optimization. Namely, make sure that your URLs, page titles, headings, and meta descriptions all include your keywords. If your website runs on WordPress, you can use a plugin such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/\">Yoast<\/a>\u00a0that\u2019ll check all of these elements for you.\r\n\r\nOf course, you shouldn\u2019t just stuff an article with keywords, hoping that search engines will pick up on your pages. Instead, aim to produce blog posts that will answer consumer questions and show them that you\u2019re a trustworthy source of information in your industry.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also advisable to pay attention to the quality of the copy you write, minding both grammatical correctness and readability. Free tools like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.grammarly.com\/\">Grammarly<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/hemingwayapp.com\/\">Hemingway<\/a>\u00a0will help meet your goals, but it\u2019s also not a bad idea to hire a professional writer.\r\n\r\nOf course, the work doesn\u2019t end once you\u2019ve hit publish. To get the best possible results, you will also need to share your content with as many people as possible. To achieve this, do regular social shares, not shying away from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/library\/the-case-for-reposting-content\/\">reposting articles that perform well<\/a>. Moreover, try to get as many\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/6-inbound-marketing-strategies-to-get-organic-backlinks\/\">high-quality backlinks<\/a>\u00a0from authority sites so that your own website\u2019s rankings improve.\r\n\r\nOther strategies to implement include guest posts, podcast interviews, influencer marketing on YouTube, and any other method that\u2019ll get your branded content in front of a wide audience.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>6. Don\u2019t Forget About Technical SEO<\/h3>\r\nThe last step to success for startups relies on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/top-10-evergreen-seo-practices-that-everyone-should-follow-for-website-ranking\/\">technical aspects of SEO<\/a>.\r\n\r\nAs you probably know, website performance, and consequently ranking, depends on a variety of factors. These include domain name, loading speed, mobile optimization, safety protocols, regular updates, etc. You can refer to Google\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/guidelines\/webmaster-guidelines\">Webmaster Guidelines<\/a>\u00a0on a list of Dos and Don\u2019ts for your website, but, generally, investing in excellent UX will take care of all the possible issues of technical SEO.\r\n\r\nOf course, if there\u2019s an element you\u2019re not sure about, it\u2019s best to consult with a professional SEO service. Alternatively, you can take the DIY route. If that\u2019s your choice, you\u2019ll need to do a thorough analysis of your site\u2019s performance with a tool like\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/analytics.google.com\/\">Google Analytics<\/a>. Furthermore, you might\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/seo-split-testing-a-b-test-changes-google\">benefit from testing practices<\/a>\u00a0to identify the small changes you can make to improve usability.\r\n\r\nIn the end, your goal should be to turn your business into a valuable resource to your potential customers, that is, a go-to address for everything related to your niche.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\r\nDespite its seemingly intimidating nature, SEO is an investment well worth making. Especially for startup owners who need to get their business off the ground. Fortunately, however, search engine optimization is not an impossible task, and you can even take the DIY route.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re doing things on your own or hiring a professional, the backbone of your SEO strategy needs to be thorough research. Pair it with a passion for your subject, value to your customers, and a website with great UX, and you\u2019ll be on your way to success. Even with a shoestring budget.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Author Bio:<\/h3>\r\nSarah Kaminski is a freelance writer and social media marketer.
