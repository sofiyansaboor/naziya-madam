It\u2019s logical that you may have a myriad of other to-do\u2019s on your mind as a company owner, but the reality is that it is important to produce high-quality content and compelling copy in today\u2019s day and age if you want to attract and retain your target audience and remain competitive in your respective industry.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly is copywriting and why is it so important? We\u2019re here to give you the rundown and teach you everything you need to know about the power of effective copy and how it can help your company turn serious revenue profits.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>What is Copywriting?<\/h3>\r\nCopywriting is any form of writing that seeks to market and boost revenue for your company. A copywriter is a professional writer who crafts marketing material intended to get individuals to take action and buy a product or service. They specialize in designing messaging that is enjoyable, simple, insightful, and aligned with an outlined brand voice.\r\n\r\nAn integral aspect of any content marketing campaign is, you guessed it, copywriters. Content marketing is a technique through which businesses produce content, such as videos, social media posts, and blog posts that do not promote goods explicitly, but rather provide relevance to their target audience and generate interest indirectly in whatever the company sells.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Why is Copywriting Important?<\/h3>\r\nCopywriting is important because it drives revenue, achieves an impressive Return On Investment (ROI), and achieves the goals of your enterprise by ensuring your target client that your product or service can address their needs and deliver them the value they never knew they needed.\r\n\r\nAn increasing amount of companies are now dedicating their time and resources toward identifying effective approaches for creating content marketing campaigns.\u00a0 In fact, a whopping 91% of respondents indicated that they were employing some form of content marketing as part of their general marketing plan, according to a survey conducted last year by trained marketers from around the world. Content marketing has become so prevalent because it is less expensive than conventional marketing methods and can yield remarkable results if executed properly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>How Can Copywriting Help Your Business?<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are countless ways in which copywriting can help your business\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/3-secret-tools-writing-blogposts-go-viral\/\">increase customer engagement<\/a>\u00a0and increase sales.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>It can provide value to your customer base<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou offer value to existing and future consumers alike when you produce entertaining, high-quality written content. The text on your websites, blogs, and product packaging are all customer-facing ways to make serious impressions that make or break your connection with your target audience.\r\n\r\nYour aim should be to generate content that is important to the desires or preferences of your intended audience while evaluating your individual content marketing plan.\r\n\r\nWhile you don\u2019t want it to sound like an advertisement, you should still aim to be reasonably discreet in advertising yourself in your copywriting campaigns. The most critical note to consider is asking if the content you\u2019re producing is helpful and if it addresses the dilemma of the reader. This will help you evaluate if the reader might find the article beneficial enough to share it with friends, which may motivate more traffic to your website.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>It can foster a genuine connection with your audience<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYou\u2019ll be able to develop a loyal client base, create trust, and communicate with customers on an emotional level by producing content that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/free-content-marketing-course-chapter-4-how-to-identify-your-audience-for-content-marketing-strategy\/\">engages your target audience<\/a>. In certain cases, the content you publish can illustrate your company\u2019s principles and ideals, or better yet, draw the curtain back a bit, humanize your business, and show viewers that you are more than just a business trying to sell things to them.\r\n\r\nTake the following screenshot for example:\r\n\r\nThis copywriting evokes emotion from the reader, explaining the benefit they\u2019ll receive from using this moving service. However, it also humanizes the company, explaining that the movers are college students who can use the consumer\u2019s support.\r\n\r\nSocial media platforms are also a great place for brands to communicate with consumers and develop unique relationship. Generating social media content and interacting with other posts can be an efficient way to communicate with your clients and address your audience directly. Clever marketing on social media can also significantly boost interaction with the brand and, in exchange, increase revenue.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>It can increase sales<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nA well-written copy will help attract more customers significantly as long as it appeals to the psychological side of prospective consumers, along with providing actionable content that tells them what to do next. Take the following screengrab from TransUnion SmartMove for example. This homepage copy shows prospective customers how easy it is to access screening reports. Succinct sentences show the process and value in less than 100 words.\r\n\r\nStrategic copywriting will evoke a certain reaction from readers, whether it\u2019s purchasing, commenting, sharing, or signing up for your email newsletter. Whatever it may be, the overarching point is to generate copy that is actionable. Without sounding manipulative or sales, a well-written copy should be able to elicit a response from your readers and clients.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what response you wish to achieve, each piece of content is generated to evoke an actionable response. If it doesn\u2019t provoke a response, it\u2019s a waste of valuable online space.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4>It can boost your company\u2019s online presence<\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b><\/b>Content that is published with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/search-engine-optimization-course\/\">SEO best practices<\/a>\u00a0will help improve the company\u2019s online visibility. Professional copywriters should know SEO and how to create material that has a greater chance of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiperform.com\/top-8-seo-hacks-to-rank-high-in-2020\/\">ranking favourably in search engines<\/a>. When it comes to your website, SEO copywriters can help refine the text, build blogs and other pieces of written material for you, and do keyword analysis to figure out which unique terms would help search engines rate a piece higher and grant you higher rankings.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re at a huge strategic advantage when your website rates extremely well in search results. Ranking higher means you can get in front of the exact audience who is searching for your goods or services online.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Wrapping Up<\/h3>\r\nEven without a boatload of experience, becoming an effective copywriter just takes a bit of research and trial and error. Doing it yourself just takes an understanding of the fundamental concepts of copywriting. That being said, do anticipate that strong copywriting will take time, and regardless of whether or not it\u2019s your strong suit or whether you have more urgent interests, it\u2019s well worth your while to allocate time toward boosting your copywriting skills.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Author Bio<\/h4>\r\nMatt Casadona has a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in Psychology.
